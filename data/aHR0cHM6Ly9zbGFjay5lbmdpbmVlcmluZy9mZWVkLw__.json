      "summary": "本文介绍了Slack的DevXP团队如何优化端到端（E2E）测试流水线，从而降低构建时间和减少冗余流程，为工程师节省时间和资源。\n\n*   **问题：** 不必要的前端构建导致耗时和资源浪费。\n*   **解决方案：** 采用更智能的构建策略，利用缓存的前端资源。\n    *   **步骤 1:** 有条件的前端构建，使用`git diff`检测前端代码变更。\n    *   **步骤 2:** 预构建资源和内部CDN，重用生产环境中的现有构建。\n*   **挑战：** 在大规模代码仓库中高效地识别前端变更和查找预构建资源。\n*   **结果：**\n    *   构建频率降低60%。\n    *   构建时间缩短50%。\n    *   每月节省数TB的存储空间。\n    *   E2E测试结果更可靠。\n    *   重新审视了遗留代码。\n\n文章强调，通过战略性地利用现有工具，可以显著提高构建效率，节省开发人员时间，并降低云成本。\n\n![Stages of the end to end testing pipeline.](https://slack.engineering/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/04/image4.png?w=640)\n\n![End to end pipeline depicting local pre-built frontends at the third stage.](https://slack.engineering/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/04/image3.png?w=640)\n\n![January baseline was an average build time of 10 minutes and 6 minutes for testing.

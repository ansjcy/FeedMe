I've built GitHub Agentic Workflows that analyze issues and surface what matters: that's the kind of judgment amplification that actually helps maintainers.'- Franck Nijhof, lead of the Home Assistant project, one of the top projects on GitHubby contributor countAgentic workflows also allow maintainers and community to experiment with repository automation together. 'Adopting GitHub’s Agentic Workflows has lowered the barrier for experimentation with AI tooling, making it significantly easier for staff, maintainers and newcomers alike. Inside of CNCF, we are benefiting from improved documentation automation along with improving team reporting across the organization. This isn't just a technical upgrade for our community, it’s part of a cultural shift that empowers our ecosystem to innovate faster with AI and agentic tooling.'- Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), whose mission is to make cloud native computing ubiquitous across the worldEnterprises are seeing similar benefits at scale. 'With GitHub Agentic Workflows, we’re able to expand how we apply agents to real engineering work at scale, including changes that span multiple repositories.

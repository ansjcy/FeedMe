      "content": "Pre-trained video models learn powerful priors for generating high-quality, temporally coherent content. While these models excel at temporal coherence, their dynamics are often constrained by the continuous nature of their training data. We hypothesize that by injecting the rich and unconstrained content diversity from image data into this coherent temporal framework, we can generate image sets that feature both natural transitions and a far more expansive dynamic range. To this end, we introduce iMontage, a unified framework designed to repurpose a powerful video model into an all-in-one image generator. The framework consumes and produces variable-length image sets, unifying a wide array of image generation and editing tasks. To achieve this, we propose an elegant and minimally invasive adaptation strategy, complemented by a tailored data curation process and training paradigm. This approach allows the model to acquire broad image manipulation capabilities without corrupting its invaluable original motion priors. iMontage excels across several mainstream many-in-many-out tasks, not only maintaining strong cross-image contextual consistency but also generating scenes with extraordinary dynamics that surpass conventional scopes.

      "content": "This paper studies Visual Question-Visual Answering (VQ-VA): generating an image, rather than text, in response to a visual question -- an ability that has recently emerged in proprietary systems such as NanoBanana and GPT-Image. To also bring this capability to open-source models, we introduce VQ-VA World, a data-centric framework built around an agentic pipeline for large-scale, targeted data construction. Leveraging web-scale deployment, this pipeline crawls a massive amount of ~1.8M high-quality, interleaved image-text samples for model training. For evaluation, we further release IntelligentBench, a human-curated benchmark that systematically assesses VQ-VA along the aspects of world knowledge, design knowledge, and reasoning. Training with VQ-VA World data yields strong empirical gains: it helps LightFusion attain 53.06 on IntelligentBench, substantially surpassing the best prior open-source baselines (i.e., 7.78 from vanilla LightFusion; 1.94 from UniWorld-V1), and significantly narrowing the gap toward leading proprietary systems (e.g., 81.67 from NanoBanana; 82.64 from GPT-Image). By releasing the full suite of model weights, datasets, and pipelines, we hope to stimulate future research on VQ-VA."

      "content": "While recent video generation models have achieved significant visual fidelity, they often suffer from the lack of explicit physical controllability and plausibility. To address this, some recent studies attempted to guide the video generation with physics-based rendering. However, these methods face inherent challenges in accurately modeling complex physical properties and effectively control ling the resulting physical behavior over extended temporal sequences. In this work, we introduce PhysChoreo, a novel framework that can generate videos with diverse controllability and physical realism from a single image. Our method consists of two stages: first, it estimates the static initial physical properties of all objects in the image through part-aware physical property reconstruction. Then, through temporally instructed and physically editable simulation, it synthesizes high-quality videos with rich dynamic behaviors and physical realism. Experimental results show that PhysChoreo can generate videos with rich behaviors and physical realism, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple evaluation metrics."

      "content": "Recent years have witnessed significant progress in Unified Multimodal Models, yet a fundamental question remains: Does understanding truly inform generation? To investigate this, we introduce UniSandbox, a decoupled evaluation framework paired with controlled, synthetic datasets to avoid data leakage and enable detailed analysis. Our findings reveal a significant understanding-generation gap, which is mainly reflected in two key dimensions: reasoning generation and knowledge transfer. Specifically, for reasoning generation tasks, we observe that explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in the understanding module effectively bridges the gap, and further demonstrate that a self-training approach can successfully internalize this ability, enabling implicit reasoning during generation. Additionally, for knowledge transfer tasks, we find that CoT assists the generative process by helping retrieve newly learned knowledge, and also discover that query-based architectures inherently exhibit latent CoT-like properties that affect this transfer. UniSandbox provides preliminary insights for designing future unified architectures and training strategies that truly bridge the gap between understanding and generation.

      "content": "Generating realistic 3D cities is fundamental to world models, virtual reality, and game development, where an ideal urban scene must satisfy both stylistic diversity, fine-grained, and controllability. However, existing methods struggle to balance the creative flexibility offered by text-based generation with the object-level editability enabled by explicit structural representations. We introduce MajutsuCity, a natural language-driven and aesthetically adaptive framework for synthesizing structurally consistent and stylistically diverse 3D urban scenes. MajutsuCity represents a city as a composition of controllable layouts, assets, and materials, and operates through a four-stage pipeline. To extend controllability beyond initial generation, we further integrate MajutsuAgent, an interactive language-grounded editing agent} that supports five object-level operations. To support photorealistic and customizable scene synthesis, we also construct MajutsuDataset, a high-quality multimodal dataset} containing 2D semantic layouts and height maps, diverse 3D building assets, and curated PBR materials and skyboxes, each accompanied by detailed annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a practical set of evaluation metrics, covering key dimensions such as structural consistency, scene complexity, material fidelity, and lighting atmosphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate MajutsuCity reduces layout FID by 83.7% compared with CityDreamer and by 20.1% over CityCraft. Our method ranks first across all AQS and RDR scores, outperforming existing methods by a clear margin. These results confirm MajutsuCity as a new state-of-the-art in geometric fidelity, stylistic adaptability, and semantic controllability for 3D city generation. We expect our framework can inspire new avenues of research in 3D city generation. Our dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/LongHZ140516/MajutsuCity."

      "content": "Reinforcement learning (RL) plays an increasingly important role in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet stable and performant policy optimization remains challenging. Token-level importance ratios often exhibit high variance-a phenomenon exacerbated in Mixture-of-Experts models-leading to unstable updates. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GSPO and GRPO, alleviate this problem via hard clipping, making it difficult to maintain both stability and effective learning. We propose Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), which replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate that adaptively attenuates off-policy updates while preserving useful learning signals. Compared with GSPO and GRPO, SAPO is both sequence-coherent and token-adaptive. Like GSPO, SAPO maintains sequence-level coherence, but its soft gating forms a continuous trust region that avoids the brittle hard clipping band used in GSPO. When a sequence contains a few highly off-policy tokens, GSPO suppresses all gradients for that sequence, whereas SAPO selectively down-weights only the offending tokens and preserves the learning signal from the near-on-policy ones, improving sample efficiency. Relative to GRPO, SAPO replaces hard token-level clipping with smooth, temperature-controlled scaling, enabling more informative and stable updates. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks indicate that SAPO exhibits improved training stability and higher Pass@1 performance under comparable training budgets. Moreover, we employ SAPO to train the Qwen3-VL model series, demonstrating that SAPO yields consistent performance gains across diverse tasks and different model sizes. Overall, SAPO provides a more reliable, scalable, and effective optimization strategy for RL training of LLMs."

      "content": "Despite advances, video diffusion transformers still struggle to generalize beyond their training length, a challenge we term video length extrapolation. We identify two failure modes: model-specific periodic content repetition and a universal quality degradation. Prior works attempt to solve repetition via positional encodings, overlooking quality degradation and achieving only limited extrapolation. In this paper, we revisit this challenge from a more fundamental view: attention maps, which directly govern how context influences outputs. We identify that both failure modes arise from a unified cause: attention dispersion, where tokens beyond the training window dilute learned attention patterns. This leads to quality degradation and repetition emerges as a special case when this dispersion becomes structured into periodic attention patterns, induced by harmonic properties of positional encodings. Building on this insight, we propose UltraViCo, a training-free, plug-and-play method that suppresses attention for tokens beyond the training window via a constant decay factor. By jointly addressing both failure modes, we outperform a broad set of baselines largely across models and extrapolation ratios, pushing the extrapolation limit from 2x to 4x. Remarkably, it improves Dynamic Degree and Imaging Quality by 233% and 40.5% over the previous best method at 4x extrapolation. Furthermore, our method generalizes seamlessly to downstream tasks such as controllable video synthesis and editing."

      "content": "Vision-language agents have achieved remarkable progress in a variety of multimodal reasoning tasks; however, their learning remains constrained by the limitations of human-annotated supervision. Recent self-rewarding approaches attempt to overcome this constraint by allowing models to act as their own critics or reward providers. Yet, purely text-based self-evaluation struggles to verify complex visual reasoning steps and often suffers from evaluation hallucinations. To address these challenges, inspired by recent advances in tool-integrated reasoning, we propose Agent0-VL, a self-evolving vision-language agent that achieves continual improvement with tool-integrated reasoning. Agent0-VL incorporates tool usage not only into reasoning but also into self-evaluation and self-repair, enabling the model to introspect, verify, and refine its reasoning through evidence-grounded analysis. It unifies two synergistic roles within a single LVLM: a Solver that performs multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning, and a Verifier that generates structured feedback and fine-grained self-rewards through tool-grounded critique. These roles interact through a Self-Evolving Reasoning Cycle, where tool-based verification and reinforcement learning jointly align the reasoning and evaluation distributions for stable self-improvement. Through this zero-external-reward evolution, Agent0-VL aligns its reasoning and verification behaviors without any human annotation or external reward models, achieving continual self-improvement. Experiments on geometric problem solving and visual scientific analysis show that Agent0-VL achieves an 12.5% improvement over the base model.

Their joint optimization enables the scalable synthesis of embodied interaction data that is visually compelling, spatially coherent, physically plausible, and instruction-aligned. Training at scale is made feasible through our efficient GigaTrain framework, which exploits FP8-precision and sparse attention to drastically reduce memory and compute requirements. We conduct comprehensive evaluations showing that GigaWorld-0 generates high-quality, diverse, and controllable data across multiple dimensions. Critically, VLA model (e.g., GigaBrain-0) trained on GigaWorld-0-generated data achieve strong real-world performance, significantly improving generalization and task success on physical robots without any real-world interaction during training."

By integrating camera conditions into RoPE, our method generalizes to out-of-distribution camera trajectories and video lengths, yielding improved dynamic object localization and static background preservation. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements in camera controllability, geometric consistency, and video quality across various trajectories and lengths."

We find that Fara-7B outperforms other CUA models of comparable size on benchmarks like WebVoyager, Online-Mind2Web, and WebTailBench -- our novel benchmark that better captures under-represented web tasks in pre-existing benchmarks. Furthermore, Fara-7B is competitive with much larger frontier models, illustrating key benefits of scalable data generation systems in advancing small efficient agentic models.

The architecture comprises a Native Vision Transformer (ViT) and a lightweight LLM connected via an MLP adapter. HunyuanOCR demonstrates superior performance, outperforming commercial APIs, traditional pipelines, and larger models (e.g., Qwen3-VL-4B). Specifically, it surpasses current public solutions in perception tasks (Text Spotting, Parsing) and excels in semantic tasks (IE, Text Image Translation), securing first place in the ICDAR 2025 DIMT Challenge (Small Model Track). Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on OCRBench among VLMs with fewer than 3B parameters.   HunyuanOCR achieves breakthroughs in three key aspects: 1) Unifying Versatility and Efficiency: We implement comprehensive support for core capabilities including spotting, parsing, IE, VQA, and translation within a lightweight framework. This addresses the limitations of narrow \"OCR expert models\" and inefficient \"General VLMs\". 2) Streamlined End-to-End Architecture: Adopting a pure end-to-end paradigm eliminates dependencies on pre-processing modules (e.g., layout analysis). This fundamentally resolves error propagation common in traditional pipelines and simplifies system deployment. 3) Data-Driven and RL Strategies: We confirm the critical role of high-quality data and, for the first time in the industry, demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies yield significant performance gains in OCR tasks.   HunyuanOCR is officially open-sourced on HuggingFace. We also provide a high-performance deployment solution based on vLLM, placing its production efficiency in the top tier. We hope this model will advance frontier research and provide a solid foundation for industrial applications."

The Image-to-Motion Binding process of the dominant Reference-to-Video (R2V) paradigm overlooks critical spatio-temporal misalignments common in real-world applications, leading to failures such as identity drift and visual artifacts. We introduce SteadyDancer, an Image-to-Video (I2V) paradigm-based framework that achieves harmonized and coherent animation and is the first to ensure first-frame preservation robustly. Firstly, we propose a Condition-Reconciliation Mechanism to harmonize the two conflicting conditions, enabling precise control without sacrificing fidelity. Secondly, we design Synergistic Pose Modulation Modules to generate an adaptive and coherent pose representation that is highly compatible with the reference image. Finally, we employ a Staged Decoupled-Objective Training Pipeline that hierarchically optimizes the model for motion fidelity, visual quality, and temporal coherence. Experiments demonstrate that SteadyDancer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both appearance fidelity and motion control, while requiring significantly fewer training resources than comparable methods."

      "content": "Diffusion-based editing enables realistic modification of local image regions, making AI-generated content harder to detect. Existing AIGC detection benchmarks focus on classifying entire images, overlooking the localization of diffusion-based edits. We introduce DiffSeg30k, a publicly available dataset of 30k diffusion-edited images with pixel-level annotations, designed to support fine-grained detection. DiffSeg30k features: 1) In-the-wild images--we collect images or image prompts from COCO to reflect real-world content diversity; 2) Diverse diffusion models--local edits using eight SOTA diffusion models; 3) Multi-turn editing--each image undergoes up to three sequential edits to mimic real-world sequential editing; and 4) Realistic editing scenarios--a vision-language model (VLM)-based pipeline automatically identifies meaningful regions and generates context-aware prompts covering additions, removals, and attribute changes. DiffSeg30k shifts AIGC detection from binary classification to semantic segmentation, enabling simultaneous localization of edits and identification of the editing models. We benchmark three baseline segmentation approaches, revealing significant challenges in semantic segmentation tasks, particularly concerning robustness to image distortions. Experiments also reveal that segmentation models, despite being trained for pixel-level localization, emerge as highly reliable whole-image classifiers of diffusion edits, outperforming established forgery classifiers while showing great potential in cross-generator generalization. We believe DiffSeg30k will advance research in fine-grained localization of AI-generated content by demonstrating the promise and limitations of segmentation-based methods.

Existing methods lack generalizability and demand extensive, time-consuming manual annotation for new clinical application. Here, we propose MedSAM-3, a text promptable medical segmentation model for medical image and video segmentation. By fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3 architecture on medical images paired with semantic conceptual labels, our MedSAM-3 enables medical Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS), allowing precise targeting of anatomical structures via open-vocabulary text descriptions rather than solely geometric prompts. We further introduce the MedSAM-3 Agent, a framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform complex reasoning and iterative refinement in an agent-in-the-loop workflow. Comprehensive experiments across diverse medical imaging modalities, including X-ray, MRI, Ultrasound, CT, and video, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing specialist and foundation models. We will release our code and model at https://github.com/Joey-S-Liu/MedSAM3."

      "content": "Realistic 3D city generation is fundamental to a wide range of applications, including virtual reality and digital twins. However, most existing methods rely on training a single diffusion model, which limits their ability to generate personalized and boundless city-scale scenes. In this paper, we present Yo'City, a novel agentic framework that enables user-customized and infinitely expandable 3D city generation by leveraging the reasoning and compositional capabilities of off-the-shelf large models. Specifically, Yo'City first conceptualize the city through a top-down planning strategy that defines a hierarchical \"City-District-Grid\" structure. The Global Planner determines the overall layout and potential functional districts, while the Local Designer further refines each district with detailed grid-level descriptions. Subsequently, the grid-level 3D generation is achieved through a \"produce-refine-evaluate\" isometric image synthesis loop, followed by image-to-3D generation. To simulate continuous city evolution, Yo'City further introduces a user-interactive, relationship-guided expansion mechanism, which performs scene graph-based distance- and semantics-aware layout optimization, ensuring spatially coherent city growth. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a diverse benchmark dataset and design six multi-dimensional metrics that assess generation quality from the perspectives of semantics, geometry, texture, and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Yo'City consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation aspects."

      "content": "Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and video agent systems have significantly improved general video understanding. However, when applied to scientific video understanding and educating, a domain that demands external professional knowledge integration and rigorous step-wise reasoning, existing approaches often struggle. To bridge this gap, we propose SciEducator, the first iterative self-evolving multi-agent system for scientific video comprehension and education. Rooted in the classical Deming Cycle from management science, our design reformulates its Plan-Do-Study-Act philosophy into a self-evolving reasoning and feedback mechanism, which facilitates the interpretation of intricate scientific activities in videos. Moreover, SciEducator can produce multimodal educational content tailored to specific scientific processes, including textual instructions, visual guides, audio narrations, and interactive references. To support evaluation, we construct SciVBench, a benchmark consisting of 500 expert-verified and literature-grounded science QA pairs across five categories, covering physical, chemical, and everyday phenomena. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SciEducator substantially outperforms leading closed-source MLLMs (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4o) and state-of-the-art video agents on the benchmark, establishing a new paradigm for the community."

The unified framework of RynnVLA-002 enables joint learning of environmental dynamics and action planning. Our experiments show that RynnVLA-002 surpasses individual VLA and world models, demonstrating their mutual enhancement. We evaluate RynnVLA-002 in both simulation and real-world robot tasks. RynnVLA-002 achieves 97.4% success rate on the LIBERO simulation benchmark without pretraining, while in real-world LeRobot experiments, its integrated world model boosts the overall success rate by 50%."

      "content": "Understanding text-rich videos requires reading small, transient textual cues that often demand repeated inspection. Yet most video QA models rely on single-pass perception over fixed frames, leading to hallucinations and failures on fine-grained evidence. Inspired by how humans pause, zoom, and re-read critical regions, we introduce Video-R4 (Reinforcing Text-Rich Video Reasoning with Visual Rumination), a video reasoning LMM that performs visual rumination: iteratively selecting frames, zooming into informative regions, re-encoding retrieved pixels, and updating its reasoning state. We construct two datasets with executable rumination trajectories: Video-R4-CoT-17k for supervised practice and Video-R4-RL-30k for reinforcement learning. We propose a multi-stage rumination learning framework that progressively finetunes a 7B LMM to learn atomic and mixing visual operations via SFT and GRPO-based RL. Video-R4-7B achieves state-of-the-art results on M4-ViteVQA and further generalizes to multi-page document QA, slides QA, and generic video QA, demonstrating that iterative rumination is an effective paradigm for pixel-grounded multimodal reasoning."

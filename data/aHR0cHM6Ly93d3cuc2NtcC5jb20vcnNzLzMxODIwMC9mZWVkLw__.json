      "summary": "## 英伟达CEO黄仁勋：Blackwell芯片对华销售“无积极讨论”\n\n英伟达（Nvidia）首席执行官黄仁勋周五表示，公司目前没有“积极讨论”向中国出售其最先进的Blackwell芯片。这一表态是在他抵达台南进行今年第四次公开访台后不久做出的。\n\n### 关键信息点：\n\n*   **Blackwell芯片的销售限制**：\n    *   Blackwell是英伟达当前的旗舰人工智能芯片。\n    *   特朗普政府一直阻止其销往中国，理由是担心该芯片可能助长中国军方和国内人工智能产业的发展。\n*   **近期猜测与实际情况**：\n    *   上周有猜测称，美国总统特朗普和中国国家主席习近平在韩国的会谈可能达成协议，允许向中国出售Blackwell图形处理单元的缩减版。\n    *   然而，迄今为止没有迹象表明双方已达成任何协议。\n*   **黄仁勋的立场**：\n    *   黄仁勋明确表示：“目前，我们不打算向中国运送任何产品。”\n    *   他补充说：“这取决于中国何时希望英伟达产品重新服务中国市场。我期待他们改变政策。”\n*   **此前芯片销售情况**：\n    *   美国曾允许英伟达向中国销售其H20芯片。\n    *   但黄仁勋在过去一个月中多次表示，中国不希望英伟达进入该国，因此其在先进AI芯片市场的份额为零。\n*   **黄仁勋访台行程**：\n    *   黄仁勋在台湾福尔摩沙电视台新闻网络的直播中表示，他此行是为了拜访公司的长期合作伙伴台积电（Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co）。\n    *   他还将参加这家合同芯片制造商的运动会。\n\n![英伟达CEO黄仁勋在2024年3月18日于加利福尼亚州圣何塞举行的公司GTC全球AI开发者大会上展示Blackwell芯片平台。图：美联社](https://img.i-scmp.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=contain,width=1024,format=auto/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/11/07/022a13ff-03eb-4fa5-8b69-ea1e8f269d51_1126e908.jpg)\n*英伟达CEO黄仁勋在2024年3月18日于加利福尼亚州圣何塞举行的公司GTC全球AI开发者大会上展示Blackwell芯片平台。图：美联社*",
      "shortSummary": "英伟达CEO黄仁勋表示，目前没有“积极讨论”向中国出售其旗舰Blackwell AI芯片。美国政府因担心其军事用途而阻止销售。尽管此前有猜测称可能允许出售缩减版，但尚未达成协议。黄仁勋称英伟达目前不计划向中国发货，并希望中国改变政策。他还提到，尽管美国允许H20芯片销售，但英伟达在华先进AI芯片市场份额为零。他此行在台湾是为访问台积电。",

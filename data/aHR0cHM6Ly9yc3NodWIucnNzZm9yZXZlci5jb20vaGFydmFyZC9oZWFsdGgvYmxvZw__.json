Prolonged or extreme heat poses serious health risks for everyone but is a particular worry for older adults. What steps can you take to manage heat-related risks, especially if you have existing health conditions or take certain medications?</p>\n        <p>“Understanding risks and recognizing signs and symptoms of heat illness are especially important for older adults,” says Dr. Wynne Armand, a primary care physician at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital, and associate director of the <a href=\"https://www.massgeneral.org/environment-and-health\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Mass General Center for the Environment and Health</a>.</p>\n        <h2>Why are older adults more likely to be affected by heat?</h2>\n        <p>As we age, our bodies undergo changes that can make it harder to deal with sudden temperature shifts, high temperatures, and heat waves. Several factors contribute to increased vulnerability:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Reduced ability to sweat:</strong> Our natural cooling mechanism — sweating — can be less efficient in older individuals.</li>\n          <li><strong>Slower physiological responses:</strong> Your body might not signal thirst or recognize overheating as quickly.</li>\n          <li><strong>Chronic health conditions:</strong> Common conditions, such as heart, lung, or kidney disease and diabetes, can impair the body's response to heat. [Source: CDC]</li>\n          <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Certain prescription and over-the-counter medications can interfere with temperature regulation or staying sufficiently hydrated.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>During periods of extreme heat or prolonged heat waves, these changes can put you in greater danger of developing heat-related illnesses. And in fact, Dr. Armand warns, older adults may run into trouble at lower temperatures than when heat alerts are broadcast.</p>\n        <h2>What is a heat-related illness?</h2>\n        <p>Heat-related illnesses occur when your body can no longer cool itself down effectively. Exposure to excessive heat puts more strain on the body, leading to a spectrum of conditions from moderate discomfort to increasingly severe and even life-threatening emergencies.</p>\n        <p>Four well-recognized heat-related illnesses are:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/heat-rash-how-to-spot-it-and-what-to-do-202308182968\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Heat rash</a>:</strong> Clusters of red or dark bumps akin to small pimples, often found in skin creases, neck, chest, or groin. Heat rash is caused by excessive sweating in hot, humid weather.</li>\n          <li><strong>Heat cramps:</strong> Muscle pain or spasms, usually in the abdomen, arms, or legs, that can occur after strenuous activity in high heat.</li>\n          <li><strong>Heat exhaustion:</strong> A more serious condition that can develop after exposure to high temperatures and inadequate fluid intake. Symptoms include heavy sweating, pale and clammy skin, weakness, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, and headache.</li>\n          <li><strong>Heat stroke:</strong> The most severe heat-related illness is a medical emergency. Heat stroke occurs when the body's cooling system is overwhelmed. Body temperature can rise quickly to 103° F or higher. Symptoms include hot, dry skin, headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion, and loss of consciousness. Heat stroke can cause damage to the brain and other vital organs.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>“The broader impact of heat exposure is not always easy to recognize,” says Dr. Armand. “For example, extreme heat can lead to heart attacks or kidney injury.”</p>\n        <h2>What to do if you recognize heat warning signs</h2>\n        <p>Recognizing the signs of heat-related illness in yourself and others is crucial so you can take prompt action. The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/extremeheat/pdf/Heat_Related_Illness.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">CDC</a> and other experts recommend taking the following steps for</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Heat rash:</strong> Stay in a cool, dry place. Keep the rash dry and wear loose-fitting cotton clothes. Try anti-itch products such an over-the-counter corticosteroid cream or calamine lotion to soothe the rash.</li>\n          <li><strong>Heat cramps:</strong> Call a halt on activity and move to a cool place. Drink water or a sports drink and wait for cramps to go away before engaging in any further activity. <em>Get medical help right away</em> if the cramps do not improve within 15 minutes or go away within an hour; if you are on a low-sodium diet; or if you have heart problems.</li>\n          <li><strong>Heat exhaustion:</strong> Move to a cool place, loosen clothes, and sip water. Take a cool bath, splash cool water on your skin, or put cool, wet cloths on your body. <em>Get medical help right away</em> if you’re throwing up, your symptoms worsen, or your symptoms last longer than one hour.</li>\n          <li><strong>Heat stroke:</strong> Call 911 right away because heat stroke is a medical emergency. Move the person to a cooler place and lower their temperature with cool cloths or a cool bath. Do not give them anything to drink.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Four ways to beat hot weather</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Dress for success.</strong> Wear lightweight, loose-fitting, and light-colored clothing.</li>\n          <li><strong>Track local weather through apps and web sites.</strong> When possible, avoid being outside in high-heat hours and plan your schedule around this. Keep an eye on the <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/ama/heatindex\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">heat index</a>, a mix of humidity and heat.</li>\n          <li><strong>Spend hot hours in cool spaces.</strong> If you don’t have air conditioning, visit a shopping mall, cooling center, senior center, or public library. Even a few hours in a cool space can help, especially during peak heat hours in the afternoon.</li>\n          <li><strong>Use fans correctly.</strong> Fans help if surrounding air is relatively cool. If air temperatures are very high, it's important to dampen your clothes or skin to help keep your body from overheating, and move to a cooler location if possible.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Ask your health care team to help you develop a personal <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/a-hot-weather-plan-is-essential-to-staying-healthy-202306142945\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">hot weather plan</a>, especially if you have chronic health conditions or regularly take medications for your health.

Some drugs can reduce sweating, alter awareness of thirst, or increase urination, leading to dehydration. Examples are:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>certain high blood pressure and heart medicines, such as diuretics (water pills), beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)</li>\n          <li>certain antipsychotic and antidepressant medicines</li>\n          <li>certain medicines for Parkinson's disease</li>\n          <li>antihistamines.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>If you take medication regularly, discuss heat safety with your doctor or pharmacist. They can advise if your medications increase your risk and suggest specific precautions. Do not stop or change prescribed medications without consulting your health care provider.</p>\n        <h2>What to know about heat if you have heart problems</h2>\n        <p>If you have cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or high blood pressure, be especially cautious during hot weather. Heat places additional stress on the heart. To stay safe:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Avoid strenuous activities, especially during the hottest part of the day (typically 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.).</li>\n          <li>Stay in air-conditioned environments as much as possible.</li>\n          <li>Drink plenty of water throughout the day even if you don't feel thirsty, unless your doctor has advised restricting fluids.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>What to know about heat if you have lung problems</h2>\n        <p>Conditions like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be aggravated by hot, humid air and air pollution, which often worsens during heat waves.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Pay attention to air quality alerts.</li>\n          <li>If you’ve been prescribed a quick-relief inhaler for asthma or COPD, keep it readily available.</li>\n          <li>Avoid outdoor activities during peak heat hours.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>What to know about heat if you have kidney problems</h2>\n        <p>Kidney function can be compromised by dehydration, a common risk during extreme heat. People with pre-existing kidney disease are more vulnerable.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Follow your doctor’s specific recommendations for staying hydrated, since fluid needs can vary with kidney disease.</li>\n          <li>Be aware of signs of dehydration such as dark urine, urinating less, dizziness, or dry mouth.</li>\n          <li>Avoid caffeinated drinks or very salty or sugary drinks, which can contribute to dehydration.</li>\n        </ul>\n    "

Garnick博士指出，40多岁男性PSA为3.5 ng/mL“绝对异常”，而60多岁男性PSA为5.5 ng/mL则可能不异常。PSA值应被视为一个连续体，水平越高与患前列腺癌的可能性越大相关。\n\n### PSA检测的局限性\n*   **可能漏诊癌症**：一项研究发现，高达15%的PSA水平低于4 ng/mL的男性实际上患有前列腺癌，其中相当一部分肿瘤具有临床意义。\n*   **高级别癌症可能PSA不高**：高级别癌细胞可能失去产生PSA蛋白质的能力，导致PSA水平不高。\n\n## 异常结果后的后续步骤\n\n过去，PSA升高通常会例行进行前列腺活检，如果发现癌症则进行治疗。如今，这种模式正在转变。\n\n### 新的后续流程\n1.  **异常PSA结果**：很可能首先进行**磁共振成像（MRI）扫描**，以识别前列腺中可疑的癌症区域。\n2.  **MRI结果为阴性**：在欧洲和美国的一些医院，PSA异常的男性可能完全避免初次活检。然而，许多医生在这种情况下仍会选择进行初次活检，然后定期进行PSA检测和MRI扫描，以确定是否需要进一步活检。\n3.  **初次活检和MRI结果为阳性**：医生将进行**靶向活检**，重点针对MRI显示有癌症证据的区域。\n4.  **确诊癌症**：\n    *   **低级别癌症**：通常通过**积极监测**进行观察，仅在后续活检和MRI扫描显示疾病恶化时才进行治疗。\n    *   **高级别癌症**：将立即进行治疗。\n\nGarnick博士表示，这种“风险适应性筛查方法”的目标是“识别确实需要治疗的临床显著性癌症，同时减少对不需要治疗的临床不显著性癌症的诊断。”\n\n## PSA检测的变体\n\n为了避免对所有PSA水平升高的男性进行活检，一些医生会进行涉及更详细PSA水平解读的额外检测：\n\n*   **游离PSA检测 (Free PSA)**：检测未与其他蛋白质结合的PSA。游离PSA百分比低与较高的癌症风险相关。\n*   **PSA密度 (PSA density)**：将总PSA水平（ng/mL）除以前列腺体积（毫升）。PSA密度为0.15 ng/mL或更高可能与前列腺癌相关。\n*   **PSA速度 (PSA velocity)**：跟踪PSA水平从一次检测到另一次检测的升高速度。\n*   **前列腺健康指数 (Prostate Health Index, PHI)**：结合了总PSA、游离PSA和一种称为proPSA的PSA类型。有证据表明它比单独的PSA更能准确诊断前列腺癌。\n\n<br>\n![戴手套的手拿着一个贴有PSA检测标签的采血管；手下方有一排其他试管，焦点模糊。](https://domf5oio6qrcr.cloudfront.net/medialibrary/16840/gettyimages-1432980561.jpg)",

Our first post addresses PSA screening for prostate cancer. In the second part of our series, we’ll describe how doctors use the PSA test to check the status of a cancer that’s being watched or treated.</p>\n        <h2>PSA testing: Screening for prostate cancer</h2>\n        <p>All prostate cells make PSA, a protein that helps to dissolve semen so that sperm cells can more easily reach and fertilize an egg. Normal and cancerous cells in the prostate each make PSA in similar amounts. But since cancer cells are leakier, they release more of the protein into the bloodstream.</p>\n        <p>PSA screening for prostate cancer came into widespread use during the early 1990s. But the test is controversial: prostate cancer grows slowly, and the concern is that PSA screening flags too many low-grade tumors that might not be harmful during a man’s life. Still, studies do suggest that PSA testing, because it can detect cancers at early and more treatable stages, can be lifesaving in some cases.</p>\n        <p>The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), an influential volunteer panel of experts in prevention and evidence-based medicine, takes a cautious stance on the matter. The USPSTF advises doctors to discuss the pros and cons of PSA screening in men ages 55 to 69, but also cautions <em>against</em> screening men over the age of 70, and gives no recommendation at all for men under 55.</p>\n        <p>Some expert groups recommend earlier screening for men in higher-risk groups. Black men, for instance, are about twice as likely to be diagnosed with and die from prostate cancer than white men. The American Cancer Society (ACS) advises PSA screening for Black men at age 45, or even earlier screening for men with first-degree relatives who developed prostate cancer at young ages, as well as for men who test positive for mutations in certain cancer risk genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2.</p>\n        <p>Importantly, activities that put pressure on the prostate gland (such as biking and sex) can cause PSA levels in blood to spike, so you should refrain from these activities for two to three days prior to testing. Health conditions affecting the prostate, such as infections, inflammation (prostatitis), or enlargement of the gland that occurs normally in older men (benign prostatic hyperplasia), can also cause PSA levels to spike in ways that are unrelated to cancer.</p>\n        <h2>What is an abnormal PSA result?</h2>\n        <p>In general, PSA levels over 4 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) in blood are considered abnormal. But doctors may also vary PSA cutoffs by age. For instance, a PSA of 3.5 ng/mL for a man in his 40s “is definitely abnormal,” says Dr. Marc B. Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and editor in chief of the <em>Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases</em>. However, a PSA of 5.5 ng/mL among men in their 60s, Dr. Garnick adds, may not be. It’s best to think of PSA values as being on a continuum, with higher levels associated with having prostate cancer.</p>\n        <p>PSA testing can sometimes miss a cancer diagnosis altogether. One study found that up to 15% of men with PSA levels under 4 ng/mL actually did have prostate cancer, and a sizeable fraction of these tumors were clinically significant. It’s also possible for high-grade cancer to be present without causing a large increase in PSA. That’s because high-grade cancer cells can lose their ability to actually make the protein.</p>\n        <h2>What are next steps after an abnormal result?</h2>\n        <p>It used to be that elevated PSA readings were followed routinely by a prostate biopsy, and then treatment if cancer was detected.</p>\n        <p>Today the paradigm is shifting. An abnormal result is now likely to be followed by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which can identify areas of the prostate gland that look suspicious for cancer. In Europe and some hospitals in the US, men with abnormal PSA readings might avoid an initial biopsy altogether if the MRI results are negative. However, many physicians will still opt for an initial biopsy in such cases, followed by periodic PSA tests and MRI scans to determine if further biopsies are needed.</p>\n        <p>If the initial biopsy and MRI results are positive, then doctors will perform a targeted biopsy focused on areas where the MRI showed evidence of cancer. If a cancer diagnosis is confirmed, then next steps will be initiated. Today, many low-grade cancers are watched with active surveillance, and treated only if follow-up biopsies and MRI scans show worsening of the disease. Higher-grade cancers will be treated immediately.</p>\n        <p>\"The goal of this risk-adapted approach to screening,\" Dr. Garnick says, is to “identify clinically significant cancers that actually do need treatment while decreasing diagnoses of clinically insignificant cancers that do not.”</p>\n        <h2>Variations on the PSA test</h2>\n        <p>Rather than subject everyone with an elevated PSA reading to a biopsy, some doctors perform additional tests that involve more detailed interpretations of PSA levels.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Free PSA</strong> testing looks for PSA that isn’t bound to other proteins. Low percentages of free PSA are associated with higher cancer risk.</li>\n          <li><strong>PSA density</strong> divides the total PSA level in ng/mL by the volume of the prostate gland in milliliters. A PSA density of 0.15 ng/mL or higher may be associated with prostate cancer.</li>\n          <li><strong>PSA velocity</strong> tracks how fast PSA levels increase from test to test.</li>\n          <li><strong>Prostate Health Index</strong> combines total PSA, free PSA, and a type of PSA called proPSA. Some evidence suggests it diagnoses prostate cancer more accurately than PSA by itself.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>In the next part of our series, we’ll address how PSA is used as a test for monitoring and managing patients with prostate cancer.</p>\n    "

      "summary": "麻疹正在卷土重来：我们能阻止它吗？\n\n![一个路牌，上面用红黑两色写着“麻疹爆发”，背景是波浪形的白色和生锈的钢板](https://domf5oio6qrcr.cloudfront.net/medialibrary/16408/gettyimages-538178055.jpg)\n\n### 背景与现状\n\n*   **历史成就受威胁**：在美国，大规模疫苗接种在20多年前成功阻止了麻疹的持续传播，这是一项重大的公共卫生 M成就。在1960年代有效疫苗问世之前，美国几乎每个孩子都曾感染麻疹，并发症（如麻疹相关肺炎、听力损失）常见，每年有400至500人死亡。\n*   **当前疫情严峻**：截至文章撰写时，美国30个州已确诊1,024例麻疹病例，多数为儿童。其中，西德克萨斯州疫情最为严重，93人住院，两名未接种疫苗的学龄儿童近期死亡，这是美国自2015年以来首次报告麻疹死亡病例。新墨西哥州也报告了一例麻疹相关死亡。\n*   **可预防性与疫苗接种率下降**：麻疹疫情是高度可预防的。据估计，当社区中95%的人接种疫苗时，个人和社区都能得到保护。然而，美国学龄儿童的麻疹疫苗接种率已从2019年的95%下降到2023年的92%。在德克萨斯州，约一半县的幼儿园疫苗接种率已低于95%，西德克萨斯州疫情中心社区的接种率仅为82%。\n*   **病例疫苗接种状态**：近期美国麻疹病例中，只有2%的人已知已完全接种疫苗，96%未接种或疫苗状态不明，1%只接种了一剂疫苗。\n\n### 关于麻疹的七个要点\n\n1.  **麻疹病毒传染性极强**：\n    *   病毒通过空气在人与人之间传播，可在空气中停留数小时。\n    *   估计每10个非免疫接触者中，有9个会感染。\n    *   其传染性远高于流感、COVID-19甚至埃博拉。\n2.  **早期诊断具有挑战性**：\n    *   感染后通常7至14天出现症状。\n    *   早期症状（发烧、咳嗽、流鼻涕）与感冒或流感等其他病毒感染相似。\n    *   几天后，口腔内出现无痛的微小白点（科氏斑），但容易被忽视或在许多病例中不存在。\n    *   一两天后出现独特的皮疹。\n    *   在科氏斑或皮疹出现前，患者已具有高度传染性，导致在诊断和采取预防措施之前，他人往往已被暴露。\n3.  **麻疹可能严重甚至致命**：\n    *   可导致多种并发症，包括：脑炎（可导致癫痫、听力损失或智力障碍）、肺炎、眼部炎症（偶尔导致视力丧失）、不良妊娠结局（如流产）、亚急性硬化性全脑炎（SSPE，一种罕见且致命的脑部疾病，可在初次感染麻疹多年后发展）。\n    *   并发症最常见于5岁以下儿童、20岁以上成人、孕妇和免疫系统受损者。\n    *   每1,000例病例中，多达3例可能致命。\n    *   在最近的疫情中，每8例病例中就有1例（共128例）需要住院治疗。\n4.  **感染麻疹可能抑制免疫系统**：\n    *   2019年哈佛医学院的一项研究发现，麻疹病毒可能清除高达四分之三的抗体，这些抗体原本能保护儿童免受先前已免疫的病毒或细菌（如流感病毒株、疱疹病毒、导致肺炎和皮肤感染的细菌）的侵害。\n    *   研究作者迈克尔·米纳博士指出：“如果您的孩子感染了麻疹，两年后又得了肺炎，您不一定会将两者联系起来。麻疹本身的症状可能只是冰山一角。”\n5.  **疫苗接种效果显著**：\n    *   两剂现有疫苗可提供97%的保护，远高于大多数其他疫苗。\n    *   极少数情况下，完全接种疫苗的人仍会感染麻疹，但疾病通常较轻，且不太可能传播给他人。\n6.  **麻疹疫苗安全可靠**：\n    *   麻疹疫苗的安全性极佳。\n    *   常见副作用包括手臂暂时性酸痛、低烧和肌肉疼痛，这与大多数疫苗接种相似。\n    *   关于麻疹或其他疫苗导致自闭症的说法已被“令人信服地驳斥”，但这种反复出现的错误信息助长了疫苗犹豫和疫苗接种率下降。\n7.  **保护自己免受麻疹感染的方法**：\n    *   **疫苗接种**：\n        *   儿童通常在1岁左右接种第一剂，4至6岁之间接种第二剂（作为麻腮风三联疫苗MMR的一部分）。\n        *   未接种疫苗的儿童或成人可以在晚些时候接种。\n        *   如果出生于1957年之后且在1968年之前接种过麻疹疫苗，应考虑重新接种或进行麻疹抗体检测（1968年之前的疫苗效果不如后来的版本；1957年之前多数人通过感染获得免疫，但这种免疫力可能减弱）。\n    *   **隔离**：\n        *   所有确诊或疑似感染麻疹的人应避免与他人密切接触，直到皮疹消退四天后。\n        *   麻疹患者佩戴口罩有助于防止传播。\n        *   家庭成员或其他密切接触者也应佩戴口罩以避免感染。\n        *   勤洗手有助于阻止病毒传播。\n    *   **检测**：如果您不确定自己的麻疹疫苗接种史或是否易感，可以考虑进行血液检测以确定是否对麻疹免疫。\n    *   **旅行前规划**：如果前往麻疹流行的地区，请确保疫苗接种是最新的。\n\n### 总结\n\n尽管近期关于麻疹的新闻令人惊讶，但也令人担忧。专家警告称，病例数（和可能的死亡人数）可能会增加。由于疫苗接种率下降，疫情必然会持续发生。一项研究估计，美国可能有900万至1500万儿童易感麻疹。但也有好消息：我们知道麻疹疫情可以得到控制，疾病本身可以被消除。了解如何保护自己和家人，并与对疫苗犹豫的人进行尊重地交流，分享从可靠来源获得的关于疾病的信息，特别是关于疫苗接种已被充分证实的安全性。",
      "shortSummary": "麻疹在美国卷土重来，已确诊千余例并出现死亡病例，主要原因是疫苗接种率下降。麻疹病毒传染性极强，可导致严重甚至致命的并发症，并可能抑制免疫系统。麻腮风疫苗（MMR）安全且高效，两剂可提供97%的保护。阻止疫情的关键在于提高社区疫苗接种率（目标95%），隔离感染者，并加强公众教育。专家警告病例可能继续增加，但强调麻疹是可预防和可消除的疾病。",

Didn’t it seem like we were done with measles?</p>\n        <p>In the US, widespread vaccination halted the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">ongoing spread of measles</a> more than 20 years ago, a major public health achievement. Before an effective vaccine was developed in the 1960s, nearly every child in the US got measles. Complications like measles-related pneumonia or hearing loss were common, and 400 to 500 people died each year.</p>\n        <p>As I write this, there have been 1,288 confirmed cases in 38 states, mostly among children. This is the largest number of cases in a year since 2000, when the disease was declared eliminated in the U.S.</p>\n        <p>The biggest outbreak is in west Texas, where 98 people have been hospitalized and two unvaccinated school-age children recently died, the first measles deaths in the US since 2015. Officials in New Mexico have also reported a measles-related death.</p>\n        <h2>Can we prevent these tragedies?</h2>\n        <p>Measles outbreaks are highly preventable. It’s estimated that when 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, both those individuals and others in their community are protected against measles.</p>\n        <p>But nationally, measles vaccination rates among school-age kids fell from 95% in 2019 to 92% in 2023. Within Texas, the kindergarten vaccination rates have dipped below 95% in about half of all state counties. In the community at the center of the west Texas outbreak, the reported rate is 82%. Declining vaccination rates are common in other parts of the US, too, and that leaves many people vulnerable to measles infections.</p>\n        <p>Only 4% of the recent cases in the US involved people known to be fully vaccinated. The rest were either unvaccinated or had unknown vaccine status (92%), or they had received only one of the two vaccine doses (4%).</p>\n        <h2>What to know about measles</h2>\n        <p>As measles outbreaks occur within more communities, it’s important to understand why this happens — and how to stop it. Here are seven things to know about measles.</p>\n        <h3>The measles virus is highly contagious</h3>\n        <p>Several communities have suffered <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34849648/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">outbreaks in recent years</a>. The measles virus readily spreads from person to person through the air we breathe. It can linger in the air for hours after a sneeze or cough. Estimates suggest nine out of 10 nonimmune people exposed to measles will become infected. Measles is far more contagious than the flu, COVID-19, or even Ebola.</p>\n        <h3>Early diagnosis is challenging</h3>\n        <p>It usually takes seven to 14 days for symptoms to show up once a person gets infected. Common early symptoms — fever, cough, runny nose — are similar to other viral infections such as colds or flu. A few days into the illness, painless, tiny white spots in the mouth (called <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549793/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Koplik spots</a>) appear. But they’re easy to miss, and are absent in many cases. A day or two later, a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448068/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">distinctive skin rash</a> develops.</p>\n        <p>Unfortunately, a person with measles is highly contagious for days before the Koplik spots or skin rash appear. Very often, others have been exposed by the time measles is diagnosed and precautions are taken.</p>\n        <h3>Measles can be serious and even fatal</h3>\n        <p>Measles is not just another cold. A <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">host of complications</a> can develop, including</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>brain inflammation (encephalitis), which can lead to seizures, hearing loss, or intellectual disability</li>\n          <li>pneumonia</li>\n          <li>eye inflammation (and occasionally, vision loss)</li>\n          <li>poor pregnancy outcomes, such as miscarriage</li>\n          <li>subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare and lethal disease of the brain that can develop years after the initial measles infection.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Complications are most common among children under age 5, adults over age 20, pregnant women, and people with an impaired immune system. Measles is fatal in up to three of every 1,000 cases.</p>\n        <p>During the latest outbreaks, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">162 cases — about one in eight — have required hospitalization</a>.</p>\n        <h3>Getting measles may suppress your immune system</h3>\n        <p>When you get sick from a viral or bacterial infection, antibodies created by your immune system will later recognize and help mount a defense against these intruders. In 2019, a study at Harvard Medical School (HMS) found that the measles virus may wipe out up to three-quarters of antibodies protecting against viruses or bacteria that a child was previously immune to — anything from strains of the flu to herpesvirus to bacteria that cause pneumonia and skin infections.</p>\n        <p>“If your child gets the measles and then gets pneumonia two years later, you wouldn’t necessarily tie the two together. The symptoms of measles itself may be only the tip of the iceberg,” said the study’s first author, Dr. Michael Mina, who was a postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory of geneticist Stephen Elledge at HMS and Brigham and Women’s Hospital at the time of the study.</p>\n        <p>In this video, Mina and Elledge discuss their findings.</p>\n        <div class=\"iframe-wrapper\">\n          <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q_tVZbgcV7s?si=05_KZdv5XrKbuncm\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\"></iframe>\n        </div>\n        <h3>Vaccination is highly effective</h3>\n        <p>Two doses of the current vaccine provide 97% protection — much higher than most other vaccines. &nbsp;Rarely, a person gets measles despite being fully vaccinated. When that happens, the disease tends to be milder and less likely to spread to others.</p>\n        <h3>The measles vaccine is safe</h3>\n        <p>&nbsp;The safety profile of the measles vaccine is excellent. Common side effects include temporary soreness in the arm, low-grade fever, and muscle pain, as is true for most vaccinations. A suggestion that measles or other vaccines cause autism has been <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9464417/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">convincingly discredited</a>. However, this often-repeated misinformation has contributed to significant vaccine hesitancy and falling rates of vaccination.</p>\n        <h3>Ways to protect yourself from measles infection</h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Vaccination.</strong> Usually, children are given the first dose around age 1 and the second between ages 4 and 6 as part of the Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine. If a child — or adult — hasn’t been vaccinated, they can have these doses later.<br><br>\nIf you were born after 1957 and received a measles vaccination before 1968, consider getting revaccinated or tested for measles antibodies (see below). The vaccine given before 1968 was less effective than later versions. And before 1957, most people became immune after having measles, although this immunity can wane.</li>\n          <li><strong>Isolation.</strong> To limit spread, everyone diagnosed with measles and anyone who might be infected should avoid close contact with others until four days after the rash resolves.</li>\n          <li><strong>Mask-wearing</strong> by people with measles can help prevent spread to others. Household members or other close contacts should also wear a mask to avoid getting it.</li>\n          <li><strong>Frequent handwashing</strong> helps keep the virus from spreading.</li>\n          <li><strong>Testing.</strong> If you aren’t sure about your measles vaccination history or whether you may be vulnerable to infection, consider having a blood test to find out if you’re immune to measles. Memories about past vaccinations can be unreliable, especially if decades have gone by, and immunity can wane.</li>\n          <li><strong>Pre-travel planning.</strong> If you are headed to a place where measles is common, make sure you are up to date with vaccinations.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>The bottom line</h2>\n        <p>While news about measles in recent months may have been a surprise, it’s also alarming. Experts warn that the number of cases (and possibly deaths) are likely to increase. And due to falling vaccination rates, outbreaks are bound to keep occurring. One study estimates that between nine and 15 million children in the US <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9197781/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">could be susceptible to measles</a>.</p>\n        <p>But there’s also good news: we know that measles outbreaks can be contained and the disease itself can be eliminated. Learn how to protect yourself and your family. Engage respectfully with people who are vaccine hesitant: share what you’ve learned from reliable sources about the disease, especially about the well-established safety of vaccination.</p>\n    "

Other possible serious health effects include <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/wildfire-smoke-course/health-effects-attributed-wildfire-smoke\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">heart failure, heart attacks, and strokes</a>.</p>\n        <h2>Who needs to be especially careful?</h2>\n        <p>Those most at risk from wildfire smoke include children, older adults, outdoor workers, and anyone who is pregnant or who has heart or lung conditions.</p>\n        <p>If you have a chronic health condition, talk to your doctor about how the smoke might affect you. Find out what symptoms should prompt medical attention or adjustment of your medications. This is especially important if you have lung problems or heart problems.</p>\n        <h2>What can you do to prepare for wildfire emergencies?</h2>\n        <p>If you live in an area threatened by wildfires, or where heat and dry conditions make them more likely to occur:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Create an <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/wildfires/safety/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/wildfires/beforefire.html\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">evacuation plan</a> for your family before a wildfire occurs.</li>\n          <li>Make sure that you have several days on hand of medications, water, and food that doesn’t need to be cooked. This will help if you need to leave suddenly due to a wildfire or another <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/natural-disasters-strike-everywhere-ways-to-help-protect-your-health-202301202878\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">natural disaster</a>.</li>\n          <li>Regularly check this <a href=\"https://fire.airnow.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">fire and smoke map</a>, which shows current wildfire conditions and has links to state advisories.</li>\n          <li>Follow alerts from local officials if you are in the region of an active fire.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>What steps can you take to lower health risks during poor air quality days?</h2>\n        <p>These six tips can help you stay healthy during wildfire smoke advisories and at other times when air quality is poor:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Stay aware of air quality.</strong><a href=\"https://www.airnow.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">AirNow.gov</a> shares real-time air quality risk category for your area accompanied by activity guidance. When recommended, stay indoors, close doors, windows, and any outdoor air intake vents.</li>\n          <li><strong>Consider buying an air purifier.</strong> This is also important even when there are no regional wildfires if you live in a building that is in poor condition. The EPA recommends <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/ozone-generators-are-sold-air-cleaners\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">avoiding air cleaners that generate ozone</a>, which is also a pollutant.</li>\n          <li><strong>Understand your HVAC system if you have one.</strong> The quality and cleanliness of your filters counts, so choose <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/wildfire-smoke-course/preparing-fire-season\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">high-efficiency filters</a> if possible, and replace these as needed. It’s also important to know if your system has outdoor air intake vents.</li>\n          <li><strong>Avoid creating indoor pollution.</strong> That means no smoking, no vacuuming, and no burning of products like candles or incense. Avoid frying foods or using gas stoves, especially if your stove is not well ventilated.</li>\n          <li><strong>Make a “clean room.”</strong> Choose a room with fewer doors and windows. Run an air purifier that is the appropriate size for this room, especially if you are not using central AC to keep cool.</li>\n          <li><strong>Minimize outdoor time and wear a mask outside.</strong> Again, ensuring that you have several days of medications and food that doesn’t need to be cooked will help. If you must go outdoors, minimize time and level of activity. A well-fitted N95 or KN95 mask or P100 respirator can help keep you from breathing in small particles floating in smoky air.</li>\n        </ul>\n    "

Perhaps it’s long overdue: in many ways, magnesium has been overlooked, underappreciated, or even <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30987399/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">forgotten</a>. That may be ending.</p>\n        <p>But why is magnesium getting so much attention lately? Are claims about its benefits true? Are you getting enough magnesium, or should you join the rising number of people who take magnesium supplements every day? If you have these questions, this post is for you.</p>\n        <h2>What is magnesium?</h2>\n        <p>Magnesium is a mineral the human body needs to function properly. It’s especially important for a healthy cardiovascular system, nerves, muscles, and bones. It helps regulate the body’s calcium and blood sugar levels, and it’s vital for the body’s production of protein. And that’s just the short list: more than <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">300 chemical reactions in the body</a> rely, at least in part, on magnesium.</p>\n        <h2>Are you getting enough magnesium?</h2>\n        <p>Most of us don’t need to fret over how much magnesium we’re getting. The recommended daily amount of magnesium — 320 milligrams (mg) a day for women and 420 mg a day for men — isn’t difficult to take in through a healthy diet.</p>\n        <p>But getting extra magnesium is important for people with magnesium deficiency, and those who have complications of pregnancy known as preeclampsia and eclampsia.</p>\n        <p>More limited evidence suggests that extra magnesium could also be helpful for people with:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39683617/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">cardiovascular disease</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/magnesium-and-blood-pressure-whats-the-evidence\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">high blood pressure</a> or coronary artery disease</li>\n          <li>\n            <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39252819/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">insomnia</a>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40005053/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">migraines</a>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38817505/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">anxiety</a>\n          </li>\n          <li><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34836329/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">diabetes</a> and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39891959/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">diabetic neuropathy</a></li>\n          <li><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38970118/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">muscle soreness</a> after exercise</li>\n          <li><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32969946/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">constipation</a>.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>There are even studies suggesting that magnesium supplements might help with <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/magnesium-rich-foods-might-boost-brain-health-especially-in-women\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">brain health</a> and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15724865/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">smoking cessation</a>.</p>\n        <p>Many studies of the potential benefits of magnesium are quite small, and some have <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/hfp-constituent-updates/fda-announces-qualified-health-claim-magnesium-and-reduced-risk-high-blood-pressure\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">inconsistent results</a>. Despite the shaky evidence for many claims, this large and expanding list of proposed health benefits is one reason magnesium supplements have been increasingly popular in recent years.</p>\n        <h2>Is there a test to check magnesium levels?</h2>\n        <p>A blood test can measure whether you’re getting enough magnesium. The normal range for blood magnesium is 1.7 to 2.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).</p>\n        <p>In general, the body does a great job of regulating the blood levels of magnesium. If levels rise, the kidney dumps excess magnesium into the urine; if levels fall, the kidneys hold onto more magnesium, bones release the mineral into the circulation, and the intestinal absorption of magnesium from the diet increases.</p>\n        <h2>What are the symptoms of low magnesium?</h2>\n        <p>The symptoms of too little magnesium (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK500003/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">hypomagnesemia</a>) include nausea, fatigue, and reduced appetite. Of course, these symptoms can be due to many other conditions, such as a stomach bug or medication side effects.</p>\n        <p>When severe, low magnesium may cause numbness in the arms and legs, muscle cramps, and an abnormal heart rhythm.</p>\n        <p>Some common causes of magnesium deficiency are:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>malnutrition (or simply choosing a diet that’s low in magnesium)</li>\n          <li>gastrointestinal conditions (such as <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/crohns-disease-a-to-z\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Crohn’s disease</a>) that cause vomiting, diarrhea, or poor absorption of magnesium</li>\n          <li>kidney disease, some types of which cause excess loss of magnesium in the urine</li>\n          <li>medications like diuretics or certain types of chemotherapy</li>\n          <li>alcohol use disorder, because alcohol can <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34200366/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">boost the loss of magnesium in the urine</a>.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Studies also suggest that magnesium deficiency <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7912123/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">is common among adults over age 70</a>. The reasons include low intake of magnesium, poor absorption in the digestive tract, use of certain medicines, and kidney disease.</p>\n        <h2>What are the symptoms of too much magnesium?</h2>\n        <p>The symptoms of too much magnesium (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549811/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">hypermagnesemia</a>) include nausea, headache, muscle weakness, and trouble breathing.</p>\n        <p>Hypermagnesemia is quite rare. Most people with higher-than-normal blood levels of magnesium have kidney failure. Others may be taking too much magnesium in supplements or taking certain medicines (such as magnesium-containing laxatives).</p>\n        <h2>Which foods are good sources of magnesium?</h2>\n        <p>Magnesium-rich foods like green, leafy vegetables (such as spinach), beans, nuts, and whole grains will help you get there. Pumpkin seeds, soy milk, bananas, and dark chocolate (in moderation!) are also good sources.</p>\n        <p>Eating one serving of spinach, an ounce of almonds, and a banana provides 190 mg of magnesium. That’s nearly 60% of the daily recommendation for women and 45% for men. Fortunately, magnesium is found in many healthy foods, so a good diet (such as the <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/guide-to-the-mediterranean-diet\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Mediterranean diet</a>) will usually provide all the magnesium that you need.</p>\n        <h2>Should you take a magnesium supplement?</h2>\n        <p>Unless you have a diagnosed or suspected magnesium deficiency, or a condition with clear evidence of benefit such as preeclampsia or Crohn’s disease, there’s no compelling reason to routinely take a magnesium supplement.</p>\n        <p>For some conditions, such as insomnia or migraine headaches, a magnesium supplement may be worth a try. But it’s a good idea to run this by your doctor first. All supplements come with a risk of side effects. In the case of magnesium, this includes nausea and diarrhea. Magnesium supplements can also interact with other medicines and supplements you’re taking.</p>\n        <h2>Which type of magnesium is best?</h2>\n        <p>Magnesium found in foods is usually the best choice. When needed, magnesium supplements are available in several different forms, including:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>magnesium citrate, which is often taken as a laxative for gut health</li>\n          <li>magnesium glycinate, which is commonly promoted for improved sleep and reduced anxiety</li>\n          <li>magnesium oxide, which tends to be taken for constipation or indigestion.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>All of these can provide extra magnesium. So the choice mostly comes down the reason you’re taking it, whether you experience side effects, cost, and personal preference.</p>\n        <p>Daily supplements of <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">less than 350 mg usually are considered safe</a>. But when people have certain health conditions such as kidney disease, it can be tricky to get the right amount of magnesium, and monitoring blood levels is important.</p>\n        <p>It’s safest to check with your doctor if you’re wondering whether to start taking a magnesium supplement, or unsure which one or how much to take.</p>\n        <h2>The bottom line</h2>\n        <p>Most people are fine without paying too much attention to their magnesium status. If you have concerns about whether you’re getting enough magnesium and whether you should take a supplement, ask your doctor about it. But don’t be surprised if you get some familiar advice: Choose a healthy, well-balanced diet. Your body will take care of the rest.</p>\n    "

Garnick博士，探讨了70岁以上男性转移性前列腺癌的检测、诊断和治疗。\n\n### 筛查指南与实践\n\n*   **USPSTF建议：** 美国预防服务工作组（USPSTF）不建议对70岁以上男性进行常规PSA（前列腺特异性抗原）筛查。原因在于前列腺癌通常生长缓慢，该年龄段男性更有可能“带癌生存”而非“死于癌症”，且治疗PSA检测出的癌症的生存益处可能无法抵消治疗的危害。\n*   **实际情况：** 尽管有指南，但许多70岁以上男性在出现症状（如排尿困难、疲劳、骨痛）后仍会进行PSA检测，有时会发现晚期转移性前列腺癌。USPSTF的PSA筛查指南（上次更新于2018年）已逾期，随着70岁以上男性预期寿命的增加，新指南备受期待。\n\n### 诊断与分级\n\n1.  **PSA阳性后的后续检测：**\n    *   通常进行前列腺穿刺活检。\n    *   直肠指检（DRE）以检查前列腺异常。\n    *   越来越多地使用前列腺磁共振成像（MRI）扫描，以提供更精确的诊断信息并指导活检。\n2.  **判断癌症侵袭性：**\n    *   侵袭性肿瘤的细胞形状和大小不规则，并可能侵犯邻近组织。\n    *   **格里森评分（Gleason score）：** 传统方法，根据活检样本中两种最常见的癌细胞模式进行分级。\n    *   **五级分级系统（Grade Group）：** 简化后的系统，将肿瘤分为1至5级，与格里森评分相关联（例如，格里森3+3=6对应1级，4+5=9对应5级）。\n    *   **有丝分裂率：** 评估癌细胞分裂速度。\n    *   **基因检测：** 例如，BRCA1和BRCA2基因突变与更具侵袭性的疾病风险相关，并对家庭成员有影响（增加乳腺癌和卵巢癌风险）。\n3.  **判断癌症是否转移：**\n    *   **传统方法（日益过时）：** 腹部和骨盆CT扫描、骨扫描，用于检查淋巴结和骨骼转移。\n    *   **现代方法：** PSMA（前列腺特异性膜抗原）扫描，能更有效地检测出其他影像学检查难以发现的微小肿瘤。\n    *   **转移程度分类：** 根据转移范围分为高容量或低容量疾病。仅有3-5处转移的患者被称为寡转移性前列腺癌。\n\n### 治疗方案\n\n*   **低容量转移性前列腺癌：**\n    *   **双联疗法：** 两种药物联合使用，通过剥夺睾酮（前列腺癌生长所需激素）来抑制肿瘤。\n        *   亮丙瑞林（Lupron）：阻断睾酮生成。\n        *   雄激素受体通路抑制剂（ARPIs）：阻止睾酮与细胞受体结合（如恩扎卢胺、达拉鲁胺、阿帕鲁胺、阿比特龙）。\n*   **癌症进展：**\n    *   **三联疗法：** 在双联疗法基础上增加化疗。根据癌症扩散程度，也可直接采用三联疗法。\n*   **其他治疗：**\n    *   **Lutetium-177（放射性配体疗法）：** 针对PSMA阳性疾病，通过静脉注射，利用微小放射性粒子靶向并杀死表达PSMA的细胞。\n    *   **转移灶定向治疗（MTD）：** 对寡转移性前列腺癌患者，通过体外高聚焦放射束治疗转移灶。\n*   **基因检测阳性后的靶向治疗：**\n    *   **BRCA1或BRCA2突变：** 双联疗法加PARP抑制剂（如奥拉帕利、卢卡帕利）。\n    *   **微卫星不稳定性：** 帕博利珠单抗。\n\n### 预后展望\n\n*   转移性前列腺癌的预后已显著改善。过去预后很差，现在许多患者可以带病生存10年或更长时间。\n*   新的治疗策略包括直接对前列腺本身进行放疗，即使癌症已扩散到前列腺腺体之外，这在过去是不会考虑的。\n\n### 最终建议\n\n*   在开始激素治疗前，建议男性进行心脏评估。激素疗法可能加剧心血管风险因素，因此应在治疗前和治疗期间进行处理。",
      "shortSummary": "70岁以上男性转移性前列腺癌的检测和治疗正不断发展。尽管USPSTF不建议常规PSA筛查，但症状出现后仍需检测。诊断方法包括PSA、活检、MRI和PSMA扫描。癌症侵袭性通过格里森评分和基因检测（如BRCA）评估。治疗方案多样，包括双联/三联激素疗法、靶向治疗（PARP抑制剂）、放射性配体疗法（Lutetium-177）和转移灶定向放疗。得益于新疗法，患者预后显著改善，许多人可带病生存10年以上。开始激素治疗前应进行心脏评估。",

This independent panel of experts in preventive and primary care recommends <em>against</em> screening for prostate cancer in men older than 70.</p>\n        <p>Why? Prostate cancer tends to be slow-growing. Men in this age group are more likely to die with the disease rather than from it. And in the view of the USPSTF, survival benefits from treating PSA-detected prostate cancer in older men are unlikely to outweigh the harms of treatment.</p>\n        <p>Still, that leaves open the possibility that men could be screened for prostate cancer only after their disease has advanced to symptomatic stages. For a perspective on PSA screening and advanced prostate cancer treatment in older men, we spoke with Dr. Marc B. Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and editor in chief of the <em>Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases.</em></p>\n        <p>\n          <em>Q. How often should men over the age of 70 be screened for prostate cancer?</em>\n        </p>\n        <p>Such testing is performed outside of guidelines, and generally following a discussion with the patient’s physician. It's not unusual for us to find advanced metastatic prostate cancer in older men flagged by a PSA test. The disease might spread asymptomatically, but some men get a PSA test only after they have advanced prostate cancer symptoms such as trouble urinating, fatigue, or bone pain.</p>\n        <p>The USPSTF's PSA screening guidelines are long overdue for an update — they were last published in 2018. And with life expectancy increasing overall for men over 70, we are all anxiously awaiting the new guidelines, which are generally updated every six years.</p>\n        <p>\n          <em><strong>Q.</strong> What sort of other tests follow after a positive result with PSA screening?</em>\n        </p>\n        <p>Typically, a prostate needle biopsy. And I also recommend a digital rectal exam (DRE) to feel for any abnormalities in the prostate gland. President Biden was having urinary symptoms at the time of his PSA test, and he was reported to have had a nodule noted on his DRE. We do not know what his PSA score was.</p>\n        <p>Recently, we've been moving toward magnetic resonance imaging scans of the prostate that provide more diagnostic information, and can serve as a guide to more precisely identify abnormalities in the prostate gland that we can sample with a biopsy.</p>\n        <p>\n          <em><strong>Q.</strong> How do we know if the cancer is likely to spread aggressively?</em>\n        </p>\n        <p>The more aggressive tumors have cells with irregular shapes and sizes that can invade into adjoining tissues. A time-honored measure called the Gleason score grades the two most common cancer cell patterns that pathologists see on a biopsy sample.</p>\n        <p>That system has now undergone some labelling changes. To simplify matters, doctors developed a five-tier grading system that ranks tumors from Grade Group 1 — the least dangerous — to Grade Group 5, which is the most dangerous. These Grade Groups still correlate with Gleason scores. For instance, a Gleason score of 3+3=6 correlates with Grade Group 1 for low-risk prostate cancer, whereas a Gleason score of 4+5=9 for high-risk disease correlates with Grade Group 5.</p>\n        <p>We can also evaluate how fast cancer cells are dividing — this measure is called mitotic rate — or order genetic tests that provide additional information. We know that men who test positive for inherited BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations are at risk for more aggressive disease, for instance. BRCA test results also have implications for family members, since the same mutations elevate risks for other inherited cancers including breast cancer and ovarian cancer.</p>\n        <p>\n          <em><strong>Q.</strong> How do you know if the cancer is metastasizing?</em>\n        </p>\n        <p>Traditionally, patients would get a computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis along with a bone scan. These tests look for metastases in the lymph nodes and bones, but they are increasingly outdated. These days, doctors are more likely to scan for a protein called prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) that can be expressed at high levels on tumor cell surfaces.</p>\n        <p>A PSMA scan is much better at detecting prostate tumors in the body that are still too small to see with other imaging tests. If the scans show evidence of metastatic spread, we classify men as having either high- or low-volume disease depending on the extent. Men with no more than three to five metastases are described as having oligometastatic prostate cancer.</p>\n        <p>\n          <em><strong>Q.</strong> What treatment options are available for metastatic prostate cancer?</em>\n        </p>\n        <p>We generally don't begin with a single drug. Men with low-volume metastatic prostate cancer typically get doublet therapy, which is a combination of two drugs that each starve tumors of testosterone, a hormone that prostate cancer needs to grow.</p>\n        <p>One of the drugs, called leoprolide (Lupron), blocks testosterone production. The other drugs are drawn from a class of medications that prevent testosterone from binding to its cell receptor. Those drugs are called androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs). They include enzalutamide (Xtandi), daralutamide (Nubeqa), apaludamide (Erleada), or another drug with a slightly different mechanism called abiraterone (Zytiga).</p>\n        <p>If the cancer progresses on doublet therapy, then we can add chemotherapy to the mix. This is called triplet therapy (Lupron + ARPI + chemotherapy). We may also recommend immediate triplet therapy depending upon the extent of the cancer spread.</p>\n        <p>Some men are eligible for other treatments as well. For instance, men with PSMA-positive disease (meaning their cells express the protein in high amounts) can be treated with an intravenously-delivered therapy called Lutetium-177. Known as a radioligand, this type of therapy seeks out PSMA-expressing cells and kills them with tiny radioactive particles.</p>\n        <p>Some men are eligible for metastasis-directed therapy (MTD). In such cases, we treat metastatic deposits with highly focused beams of radiation delivered from outside the body. MTD is generally reserved for patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer.</p>\n        <p>\n          <em><strong>Q.</strong> What happens if a patient is positive on a genetic test for prostate cancer?</em>\n        </p>\n        <p>That opens up options for so-called targeted therapy — which is a term we use to describe treatments that target specific cell changes that cause tumors to grow. Patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, for instance, can start on doublet therapy plus a targeted therapy called a PARP inhibitor. Two PARP inhibitors are approved for prostate cancer in BRCA-positive men: olaparib (Lynparza) and rucaparib (Rubraca). Men with a different gene mutation called microsatellite instability are eligible for a targeted drug called pembrolizumab (Keytruda).</p>\n        <p>\n          <em><strong>Q.</strong> How is the outlook for metastatic prostate cancer changing?</em>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"MsoCommentText\">It's improving dramatically! Metastatic prostate cancer used to carry a very poor prognosis. Today, it's not unusual for men to live 10 years or longer with the disease. We're even starting to treat cancer in the prostate directly — something we didn't do in the past since the cancer had already spread beyond the prostate gland. More recent studies have shown improvements from delivering radiation to the prostate gland itself in patients with metastatic cancer. We're including these treatments more often now, which is something we wouldn't have considered before.</p>\n        <p>\n          <em><strong>Q.</strong> Any final notes?</em>\n        </p>\n        <p>I would advise men to undergo a cardiac evaluation prior to starting on hormonal therapy. Hormonal therapies can exacerbate cardiovascular risk factors, so these should be addressed before and during treatment.</p>\n        <p>\n          <em>Thanks for your insights!</em>\n        </p>\n        <p>You're very welcome, glad to help.</p>\n    "

      "summary": "# 沙门氏菌很狡猾：小心提防\n\n沙门氏菌是一种常见的细菌，每年在美国导致约135万人患病，是食物中毒导致住院和死亡的主要原因。马萨诸塞州综合医院的传染病专家Elizabeth Hohmann博士指出，沙门氏菌非常“狡猾”，不仅能引发不寻常的并发症，还能以令人惊讶的方式感染人类。例如，她曾治疗一名因沙门氏菌感染导致腹主动脉瘤的患者。\n\n![沙门氏菌的插图，粉色椭圆形细菌，带有长长的粉色细丝，背景为深蓝色，带有白色高光](https://domf5oio6qrcr.cloudfront.net/medialibrary/15276/7171fb7f-4664-4932-8c4f-157875b4c28a.jpg)\n\n### 感染途径\n\n沙门氏菌常潜伏在生食或未煮熟的食物中，包括：\n*   裹面包屑的生鸡肉制品（如鸡块、基辅鸡）。\n*   有机罗勒、哈密瓜、碎牛肉、坚果酱、生曲奇面团、鸡蛋、生奶或未经巴氏消毒的牛奶、面粉。\n*   家庭饲养的家禽。\n*   小型宠物（如乌龟、青蛙）和狗粮也曾导致多州疫情。\n\n此外，通过处理受污染的食物，细菌可能从手传播到口中。即使自己未生病，也可能通过手或衣物将细菌传播给他人。Hohmann博士解释说，沙门氏菌存在于粪便和动物排泄物中，也存在于环境中，因此可以在各种无生命物体、土壤和机械中，尤其是在潮湿环境中“安家”。\n\n### 常见症状\n\n大多数沙门氏菌感染会导致胃肠炎，通常表现为胃部不适、腹部绞痛和腹泻。症状可能在摄入细菌后6小时内出现，通常在2到3天内自行消退。有些人的症状非常轻微，几乎不被察觉。\n\n**需要就医的严重症状包括：**\n*   腹部剧烈绞痛和血性腹泻。\n*   不明原因的高烧和明显疲劳。\n*   腹泻伴发烧高于102°F（约38.9°C）。\n*   腹泻三天后仍未好转。\n*   严重呕吐导致无法摄入液体。\n\n### 治疗方法\n\n多数患者无需药物即可自行康复。通过饮用清水或电解质饮料补充流失的液体，以避免脱水。\n\nHohmann博士指出，使用抗生素治疗沙门氏菌感染存在一个“恼人的悖论”：服用抗生素的患者可能比未治疗的患者排菌时间更长，这可能增加通过不良个人卫生、性行为或作为食品工作者将细菌传播给他人的风险。\n\n### 潜在并发症\n\n虽然沙门氏菌感染的严重程度因人而异，但某些人群特别容易出现严重感染，包括：\n*   65岁及以上的老年人。\n*   孕妇。\n*   5岁以下儿童。\n*   免疫系统因疾病（如癌症）或治疗（如免疫抑制药物）而受损的人群。\n\n少数感染者血液中可能存在沙门氏菌（菌血症），导致感染扩散到身体其他部位，如泌尿道、骨骼、关节或中枢神经系统（大脑和脊髓液）。在极少数情况下，沙门氏菌还可能导致已患动脉粥样硬化（动脉斑块堆积导致阻塞）的人出现不寻常的血管并发症，例如腹主动脉瘤。\n\n### 预防措施\n\n为避免沙门氏菌引起的食物中毒、疾病和住院，Hohmann博士和CDC建议采取以下策略：\n\n**1. 食物准备卫生：**\n*   用热水和肥皂清洗切过生食（包括蔬菜和水果）的砧板或盘子，然后才能用于其他用途。\n*   如果可能，为农产品、肉类和鱼类使用单独的砧板。\n*   易腐烂、已准备好或剩余的食物应在两小时内冷藏或冷冻，以阻止沙门氏菌生长。\n\n**2. 个人卫生：**\n*   在准备食物前以及接触动物、使用厕所或更换尿布后，务必用肥皂和水彻底洗手。\n*   如果宠物生病，处理其粪便时要格外小心，并在之后彻底洗手。\n\n**3. 保护易感人群：**\n*   不要让幼儿接触高风险动物，如乌龟、青蛙、鸡或鸭。如果带幼儿去宠物动物园，除非能立即消毒他们的手，否则不应让他们抚摸动物。\n*   老年人和免疫系统受损者应格外注意彻底清洗和烹饪食物。\n*   接受过器官移植（如肾脏移植）的人不应将爬行动物或两栖动物作为宠物。\n\nHohmann博士强调，虽然我们不希望人们变得偏执到用肥皂洗生菜叶，但考虑这些预防措施是值得的，特别是当家庭中有易感成员时，因为这类人群的数量正在增加。",

If you've ever had a run-in with this bacteria, you know it can cause a food-borne illness called salmonellosis, a form of food poisoning. But you may not know that <em>Salmonella</em> bacteria sicken an <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/about/index.html\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">estimated 1.35 million people</a> every year in the United States. What's more, it's the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/animal-health-literacy/get-facts-about-salmonella#statistics\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">leading cause of hospitalizations and deaths</a> due to food poisoning.</p>\n        <p>And <em>Salmonella</em> bacteria can be sneaky — not only by triggering unusual complications, but infecting people in startling ways, says Dr. Elizabeth Hohmann, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital. One patient she treated showed up with an abdominal aortic aneurysm — a dangerous bulge in the lower section of the body's largest artery — that looked infected. Testing revealed a culprit some would find surprising: <em>Salmonella</em>.</p>\n        <p>\"It's just an interesting organism and it can be kind of scary,\" she says.</p>\n        <h2>How do people get infected by <em>Salmonella</em>?</h2>\n        <p>Many of the foods <em>Salmonella</em> bacteria lurk in are raw or undercooked. Breaded raw chicken products like nuggets and <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/policy/fsis-notice/15-24\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">chicken Kiev</a> are one way it may reach your table.

Even <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/small-pets-are-delightful-but-some-carry-dangerous-bacteria-202312042998\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">small pets</a> such as turtles and frogs, along with dog food, have contributed to multistate outbreaks in recent years.</p>\n        <p>You can also become infected by handling contaminated food and spreading the bacteria from your hands to your mouth. Additionally, you can spread it to others on your hands or even on your clothes without becoming sick yourself.</p>\n        <p>\"It's a bug that's carried in stool and animal feces and is also present in the environment,\" Dr. Hohmann says. \"So it can set up shop in lots of different inanimate objects, soils, and machinery, especially in moist environments.\"</p>\n        <h2>What symptoms can <em>Salmonella</em> cause?</h2>\n        <p>Most of the time Salmonella infection leads to <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/gastroenteritis-in-adults-a-to-z\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">gastroenteritis</a>, usually causing just an upset stomach, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. These symptoms can start as soon as six hours after ingesting the bacteria. Typically, symptoms resolve on their own within two to three days.</p>\n        <p>Some people have such mild symptoms they're barely noticeable. \"The classic case might be a college student who eats a burrito from a sketchy place, gets sick for a couple of days, gets better, and doesn't think anything of it,\" says Dr. Hohmann.</p>\n        <p>Sometimes symptoms are more serious, such as severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea, or unexplained high fever and marked fatigue. These symptoms require a call to your doctor.</p>\n        <h2>How is salmonellosis treated?</h2>\n        <p>Most people will <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/food-poisoning/treatment\" target=\"_blank\">get better on their own</a> without any medicines.

Despite decades of research, science has not pinned down causes or discovered <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/topics/alzheimers-disease\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">highly effective treatments</a>. And while a healthy diet, regular exercise, and other measures can help people slow or avoid AD, we badly need more routes for preventing it.</p>\n        <p>That's why a new study is so intriguing — and potentially game-changing. Researchers have found that the risk of death due to AD is markedly lower in taxi and ambulance drivers compared with hundreds of other occupations. And the reason <em>could</em> be that these drivers develop structural changes in their brains as they work.</p>\n        <h2>Drawing a connection between Alzheimer's disease and work</h2>\n        <p>In the past two decades, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10716738/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">small studies demonstrated</a> that London taxi drivers tend to have an enlargement in one area of the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved with developing spatial memory. Interestingly, that part of the brain is one area that's commonly damaged by AD.</p>\n        <p>These observations led to speculation that taxi drivers might be less prone to AD than people with jobs that don't require similar navigation and spatial processing skills.</p>\n        <p>A <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39689964/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">recent study explores this possibility</a> by analyzing data from nearly nine million people who died over a three-year period and had occupation information on their death certificates. After accounting for age of death, researchers tallied Alzheimer's-related death rates for more than 443 different jobs. The results were dramatic.</p>\n        <h2>What did the study find?</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Taxi and ambulance drivers were much less likely to die an AD-related death than people in other occupations.</strong> AD accounted for 0.91% of deaths of taxi drivers and 1.03% of deaths of ambulance drivers. Among chief executives, AD accounted for 1.82% of deaths, which is close to the average for the general population. While these differences may seem small, they translate to more than 40% fewer deaths related to Alzheimer's among taxi and ambulance drivers.</li>\n          <li><strong>This benefit did not seem to extend to others with jobs involving navigation.</strong> For example, aircraft pilots (2.34%) and ship captains (2.12%) had some of the highest rates of death due to AD. Bus drivers (1.65%) were closer to the population average but still not nearly as low as taxi and ambulance drivers.</li>\n          <li><strong>Other types of dementia did not follow this pattern.</strong> Rates of death due to dementia other than AD were not lower among taxi and ambulance drivers.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Why would driving a taxi or ambulance affect the risk of AD-related death?</h2>\n        <p>One possible explanation is that jobs requiring frequent real-time spatial and navigational skills change both structure and function in the hippocampus. If these jobs help keep the hippocampus healthy, that could explain why AD-related deaths — but not deaths due to other types of dementia — are lower in taxi and ambulance drivers. It could also explain the older studies that found enlargement in parts of the hippocampus in people with these jobs.</p>\n        <p>And why aren't bus drivers, pilots, and ship captains similarly protected? The study authors suggest these other jobs involve predetermined routes with less real-time navigational demands. Thus, they may not change the hippocampus as much.</p>\n        <h2>What are the limitations of this study?</h2>\n        <p>A single research study is rarely definitive, especially an observational study like this one. Observational studies can only identify a relationship — not establish a firm cause — between a protective factor and a condition like AD. There could be other explanations for the findings. For example:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Information on death certificates.</strong> Researchers in this study used \"usual occupation at the time of death\" as provided by a survivor presumed to know that information. But that might not be accurate. And many people have more than one job over the course of their lives.</li>\n          <li><strong>Self-selection.</strong> Perhaps people who are prone to AD find navigation more challenging than others, and so tend to avoid these occupations. Similarly, it's possible that people who are less prone to AD tend to have better navigational skills and are more likely to pursue jobs for which that's an advantage. In this way, self-selection, rather than the occupation itself, could have contributed to the study's results.</li>\n          <li><strong>Confounders.</strong> The study's findings could be due to factors other than those assessed by the study (confounders). For example, it's possible that people whose lifelong occupation is driving a taxi or ambulance are less likely than others to smoke. Since smoking is a risk factor for AD, the lower rate of smoking, rather than the occupation, could contribute to fewer AD-related deaths among these drivers.</li>\n          <li><strong>Chance.</strong> The findings could be due to chance, especially because there were just 10 AD-related deaths among taxi drivers. Even a small number of overlooked deaths due to AD could sway the results.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>And even if driving a taxi or ambulance could lower your risk of AD-related death, what's the impact of GPS technology now in widespread use? If these jobs now require less navigational demand due to GPS, will the protective effect of these jobs evaporate?</p>\n        <h2>How might this new study help you reduce your risk of AD?</h2>\n        <p>You might wonder if these findings can be applied to anyone who wants to lower their risk of AD. For example, could outdoor treasure-hunting activities that require complex navigational skills, such as <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/orienteering-great-exercise-and-better-thinking-skills-202307102953\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">orienteering</a> and <a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/geocaching.html\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">geocaching</a>, help stave off AD? At least one small study found that <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36662692/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">orienteering experts had better spatial memory</a> than orienteering novices.</p>\n        <p>Could puzzles, video games, or even board games designed to build spatial skills reduce the risk of AD? Think Rubik's Cubes and jigsaw puzzles, Minecraft and Tetris, chess and Labyrinth. A round of Battleship, anyone? And if these activities are actually helpful, how often would you need to play?</p>\n        <p>I look forward to the results of studies exploring these questions. Until then, it's best to rely on <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/how-to-lower-your-dementia-risk\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">experts' recommendations to reduce your risk of AD</a>, including high-quality sleep, diet, and regular exercise.</p>\n        <h2>The bottom line</h2>\n        <p>I find this new research about taxi and ambulance drivers having lower rates of AD-related death fascinating. Considering how often we hear about the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/census-of-fatal-occupational-injuries/civilian-occupations-with-high-fatal-work-injury-rates.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">risks of certain jobs</a>, it's encouraging to hear about occupations that might actually protect you from disease.</p>\n        <p>If confirmed by other research, the results of this study could lead to a better understanding of Alzheimer's disease — and, more importantly, how to prevent it.</p>\n    "

For example:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>A study of more than 300,000 adults found that among those 70 and older, dementia was less common <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34788293/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">among those who had received shingles vaccination</a> than among those who did not.</li>\n          <li>A study of more than 200,000 older adults compared rates of dementia between those receiving a newer (recombinant) shingles vaccine and those who had an older (live) vaccine that is no longer approved in the US. Researchers found that the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39053634/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">risk of dementia was lower</a> six years after receiving either vaccine. But the effect was larger for the newer vaccine: those given the recombinant vaccine spent more time living dementia-free (164 days longer) compared with those given the older vaccine.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>What is a natural experiment?</h2>\n        <p>Perhaps the best evidence suggesting that shingles vaccination prevents dementia comes from a natural experiment <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40175543/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">recently published</a> in the journal <em>Nature</em>.</p>\n        <p>A natural experiment takes advantage of real-world circumstances by dividing people into an exposed group and an unexposed group and then comparing specific outcomes.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Examples of exposures might be an illness (like the COVID pandemic), a policy (like a smoking ban in one state), or a vaccination (like the shingles vaccine).</li>\n          <li>Outcomes might include virtual versus in-person learning during the pandemic, smoking-related illnesses in a state with a smoking ban compared to a state without that ban, or dementia rates among people who did or didn't receive a vaccine.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Natural experiment studies bypass the challenges of having to recruit hundreds or thousands of study subjects who might differ from one another in important ways, or who might alter their behavior because they know they're in a study. The results can be even more valuable than — and as credible as — standard randomized trials.</p>\n        <h2>What did this natural experiment study look at?</h2>\n        <p>In 2013, Wales made the shingles vaccination available to individuals based on their date of birth: anyone born <em>after</em> September 2, 1933, was eligible, while anyone born <em>before</em> that date was not. Researchers took this opportunity to analyze health records of nearly 300,000 people: half were two weeks older than the cutoff date and half were two weeks younger. The study looked at whether people developed dementia over a seven-year period.</p>\n        <p>Researchers found that compared to those who didn't get the shingles vaccination, those who received it</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>developed shingles less often</li>\n          <li>were 3.5% less likely to develop dementia over seven years (a 20% reduction)</li>\n          <li>were more likely to be protected from dementia if female.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>A study of this type cannot prove that shingles vaccination prevents dementia. But along with the studies cited above, there's a strong suggestion that it does. We'll need additional studies to confirm the benefit. We also want to understand other details of the vaccine's effect, such as whether protection applies more to some types of dementia (such as Alzheimer's disease) than others, and whether the effect of vaccination changes over time.</p>\n        <h2>Why might the shingles vaccine prevent dementia?</h2>\n        <p>With any unexpected finding in science, it's a good idea to ask whether there is a reasonable explanation behind it. Scientists call this biologic plausibility. In general, the more plausible a result is, the more likely it is to hold up in later research.</p>\n        <p>In this case, several lines of reasoning explain how a shingles vaccine might reduce the risk of dementia, including:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Reduced inflammation:</strong> Preventing shingles may prevent harmful inflammation in the body, especially in the nervous system.</li>\n          <li><strong>Impact on immune function:</strong> Vaccination might alter immune function in a way that protects against dementia.</li>\n          <li><strong>Reducing stroke risk:</strong> Some evidence shows that <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/shingles-linked-with-higher-risk-for-heart-disease-and-stroke\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">shingles may increase the risk of stroke</a>. A stroke can contribute to or cause dementia, so perhaps vaccination leads to less dementia by reducing shingles-related strokes.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>The observation that women had more protection from dementia than men after shingles vaccination is unexplained. It's possible that the immune response to vaccination is different in women, or that dementia develops differently in women compared with men.</p>\n        <h2>The bottom line</h2>\n        <p>All of us can take steps to <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/how-to-lower-your-dementia-risk\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">lower dementia risk</a>, mostly through healthy behaviors such as being active regularly and choosing a healthy diet. Evidence is mounting that shingles vaccination should be added to the list. It's a story worth following. Future studies of the shingles vaccine could even provide insights into how dementia develops, and how to better prevent and treat it.</p>\n        <p>Until then, get your shingles vaccination if you're eligible for it. It can prevent painful episodes of shingles — and may do much more.</p>\n    "

Drawing on decades of data gathered through long-term observational studies, the researchers investigated whether butter and plant oils affect mortality.</p>\n        <p>One basic takeaway? \"A higher intake of butter increases mortality risk, while a higher intake of plant-based oil will lower it,\" says Yu Zhang, lead author of the study. And importantly, choosing to substitute certain plant oils for butter might help people live longer.</p>\n        <h2>What did the study find about butter versus plant oils?</h2>\n        <p>The researchers divided participants into four groups based on how much butter and plant oils they reported using on dietary questionnaires. They compared deaths among those consuming the highest amounts of butter or plant oils with those consuming the least, over a period of up to 33 years.</p>\n        <p>Plant oils won out handily. A 15% higher risk of death was seen among those who ate the most butter compared with those who ate the least. A 16% lower risk of death was seen among those who consumed the highest amount of plant oils compared with those who consumed the least.</p>\n        <p>Higher butter intake also raised risk for cancer deaths. And higher plant oil intake cut the risk for dying from cancer or cardiovascular disease like stroke or heart attack.</p>\n        <p>While the study looked at five plant oils, only soybean, canola, and olive oil were linked with survival benefits. Swapping out a small amount of butter in the daily diet — about 10 grams, which is slightly less than a tablespoon — for an equivalent amount of those plant-based oils was linked with fewer total deaths and fewer cancer deaths, according to a modeling analysis.</p>\n        <h2>How could substituting plant oils for butter improve health?</h2>\n        <p>\"Butter has almost no essential fatty acids and a modest amount of trans fat — the worst type of fat for cardiovascular disease,\" Dr. Walter C. Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, noted by email.</p>\n        <p>By contrast, the plant oils highlighted in this study are rich in antioxidants, essential fatty acids, and unsaturated fats, which research has linked to healthier levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and lower insulin resistance.</p>\n        <p>Especially when substituted for a saturated fat like butter, plant oils also may help lower <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/an-action-plan-to-fight-unhealthy-inflammation-202205052739\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">chronic inflammation</a> within the body. Making such substitutions aligns with American Heart Association recommendations and current Dietary Guidelines for Americans for healthful eating that lower risk for chronic disease.</p>\n        <p>And for the butter lovers? \"A little butter occasionally for its flavor would not be a problem,\" says Dr. Willett. \"But for better health, use liquid plant oils whenever possible instead of butter for cooking and at the table.\" Try sampling a variety of plant oils, like different olive oils, mustard oil, and sesame oil, to learn which ones you enjoy for different purposes, he suggests. Additionally, a blend or mix of butter with oils — or sometimes a bit of butter on its own — can satisfy taste buds.</p>\n        <h2>What about study limitations and strengths?</h2>\n        <p>The study crunched data collected through a questionnaire answered every four years by more than 221,000 adults participating in the <a href=\"https://nurseshealthstudy.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Nurses' Health Study, Nurses' Health Study II</a>, and <a href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/health-professionals/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Health Professionals Follow-Up Study</a>. As is true of all observational studies, this type of research can't prove cause and effect, although it adds to the body of evidence. Because most participants were white health care professionals, the findings may not apply to a wider population.</p>\n        <p>The researchers adjusted for many variables that can affect health, including age, physical activity, smoking status, and family history of illnesses like cancer and diabetes. The size of the study, the length of follow-up, and multiple adjustments like these are all strengths.</p>\n    "

Below are five ways to boost both your individual health and the health of our planet — a combination that environmentalists call co-benefits.</p>\n        <h2>How your health and planetary health intersect</h2>\n        <p>Back in 1970, Earth Day was founded as a day of awareness about environmental issues. Never has awareness of our environment seemed more important than now. The impacts of climate change on Earth — fires, storms, <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/respiratory-health-harms-often-follow-flooding-taking-these-steps-can-help-202211092848\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">floods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-to-stay-healthy-during-a-drought-202403253026\" target=\"_blank\">droughts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/extreme-heat-staying-safe-if-you-have-health-issues-202108062563\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">heat waves</a>, rising sea levels, species extinction, and more — directly or indirectly threaten our well-being, especially for those most vulnerable. For example, <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/even-low-level-air-pollution-may-harm-health-202202212692\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">air pollution</a> from fossil fuels and <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/wildfires-how-to-cope-when-smoke-affects-air-quality-and-health-202306232947\" target=\"_blank\">wildfires</a> contributes to lung problems and hospitalizations. <a href=\"https://www.lyme.health.harvard.edu/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Geographic and seasonal boundaries for ticks</a> and mosquitoes, which are carriers of infectious diseases, expand as regions warm.</p>\n        <p>The concept of planetary health acknowledges that the ecosystem and our health are inextricably intertwined. Actions and events have complex downstream effects: some are expected, others are surprising, and many are likely unrecognized. While individual efforts may seem small, collectively they can move the needle — even ever so slightly — in the right direction.</p>\n        <h2>Five ways to improve personal and planetary health</h2>\n        <h3>Adopt plant-forward eating.</h3>\n        <p>This means increasing <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-is-a-plant-based-diet-and-why-should-you-try-it-2018092614760\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">plant-based foods</a> in your diet while minimizing meat. Making these types of choices lowers the risks of heart disease, stroke, obesity, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and many cancers. Compared to meat-based meals, plant-based meals also have many beneficial effects for the planet. For example, for the same amount of protein, plant-based meals have a lower carbon footprint and use fewer natural resources like land and water.</p>\n        <h3>Remember, not all plants are equal.</h3>\n        <p>Plant foods also <a href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-plant-based-diets-better-for-the-environment-than-less-healthy-plant-based-diets/\" target=\"_blank\">vary greatly</a>, both in terms of their nutritional content and in their environmental impact. <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/new-nutrition-facts-label/how-understand-and-use-nutrition-facts-label\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Learning to read labels</a> can help you determine the nutritional value of foods. It's a bit harder to learn about the environmental impact of specific foods, since there are regional factors. But to get a general sense, Our World in Data has a collection of eye-opening interactive graphs about various <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">environmental impacts of different foods</a>.</p>\n        <h3>Favor active transportation.</h3>\n        <p>Choose an alternative to driving such as walking, biking, or using public transportation when possible. Current health recommendations encourage adults to get 150 minutes each week of moderate-intensity physical activity, and two sessions of muscle strengthening activity. Regular physical activity improves mental health, bone health, and weight management. It also reduces risks of heart disease, some cancers, and falls in older adults. Fewer miles driven in gas-powered vehicles means cleaner air, decreased carbon emissions contributing to climate change, and less air pollution (known to cause asthma exacerbations and many other diseases).</p>\n        <h3>Start where you are and work up to your level of discomfort.</h3>\n        <p>Changes that work for one person may not work for another. Maybe you will pledge to eat one vegan meal each week, or maybe you will pledge to limit beef to once a week. Maybe you will try out taking the bus to work, or maybe you will bike to work when it's not winter. Set goals for yourself that are achievable but are also a challenge.</p>\n        <h3>Talk about it.</h3>\n        <p>It might feel as though these actions are small, and it might feel daunting for any one individual trying to make a difference. Sharing your thoughts about what matters to you and about what you are doing might make you feel less isolated and help build community. Building community contributes to well-being and resilience.</p>\n        <p>Plus, if you share your pledges and aims with one person, and that person does the same, then your actions are amplified. Who knows, maybe one of those folks along the way might be the employee who decides what our children eat from school menus, or a city planner for pedestrian walkways and bike lanes!</p>\n    "

If so, well done! Monitoring your step count can inspire you to bump up activity over time.</p>\n        <p>But when it comes to assessing fitness or cardiovascular disease risk, counting steps might not be enough. Combining steps and average heart rate (as measured by a smart device) could be a better way for you to assess fitness and gain insights into your risk for major illnesses like heart attack or diabetes. Read on to learn how many steps you need for better health, and why tagging on heart rate matters.</p>\n        <h2>Steps alone versus steps plus heart rate</h2>\n        <p>First, how many steps should you aim for daily? There's nothing special about the 10,000-steps number often touted: sure, it sounds impressive, and it's a nice round number that has been linked to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36094529/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">certain health benefits</a>. But fewer daily steps — <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">4,000 to 7,000</a> — might be enough to help you become healthier. And <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34417979/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">taking more than 10,000 steps a day might be even better</a>.</p>\n        <p>Second, people walking briskly up and down hills are getting a lot more exercise than those walking slowly on flat terrain, even if they take the same number of steps.</p>\n        <p>So, at a time when millions of people are carrying around smartphones or wearing watches that monitor physical activity and body functions, might there be a better way than just a step count to assess our fitness and risk of developing major disease?</p>\n        <p>According to a new study, the answer is yes.</p>\n        <h2>Get out your calculator: A new measure of health risks and fitness</h2>\n        <p>Researchers publishing in the <em>Journal of the American Heart Association</em> found that <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40156587/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">a simple ratio that includes both heart rate and step count</a> is better than just counting steps. It's called the DHRPS, which stands for daily heart rate per step. To calculate it, take your average daily heart rate and divide it by your average daily step count. Yes, to determine your DHRPS you'll need a way to continuously monitor your heart rate, such as a smartwatch or Fitbit. And you'll need to do some simple math to arrive at your DHRPS ratio, as explained below.</p>\n        <p>The study enrolled nearly 7,000 people (average age: 55). Each wore a Fitbit, a device that straps onto the wrist and is programmed to monitor steps taken and average heart rate each day. (Fitbits also have other features such as reminders to be active, a tracker of how far you've walked, and sleep quality, but these weren't part of this study.)</p>\n        <p>Over the five years of the study, volunteers took more than 50 billion steps. When each individual's DHRPS was calculated and compared with their other health information, researchers found that higher scores were linked to an increased risk of</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>type 2 diabetes</li>\n          <li>high blood pressure (hypertension)</li>\n          <li>coronary atherosclerosis, heart attack, and heart failure</li>\n          <li>stroke.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>The DHRPS had stronger associations with these diseases than either heart rate or step count alone. In addition, people with higher DHRPS scores were less likely to report good health than those who had the lowest scores. And among the 21 study subjects who had exercise stress testing, those with the highest DHRPS scores had the lowest capacity for exercise.</p>\n        <h2>What counts as a higher score in this study?</h2>\n        <p>In this study, DHRPS scores were divided into three groups:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Low:</strong> 0.0081 or lower</li>\n          <li><strong>Medium:</strong> higher than 0.0081 but lower than 0.0147</li>\n          <li><strong>High:</strong> 0.0147 or higher.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>How to make daily heart rate per step calculations</h2>\n        <p>Here's how it works. Let's say that over a one-month period your average daily heart rate is 80 and your average step count is 4,000. That means your DHRPS equals 80/4,000, or 0.0200. If the next month your average heart rate is still 80 but you take about 6,000 steps a day, your DHRPS is 80/6,000, or 0.0133. Since lower scores are better, this is a positive trend.</p>\n        <h2>Should you start calculating your DHRPS?</h2>\n        <p>Do the results described in this study tempt you to begin monitoring your DHRPS? You may decide to hold off until further research confirms actual health benefits from knowing that ratio.</p>\n        <p>This study merely explored the relationship between DHRPS and risk of diabetes or cardiovascular disease like heart attack or stroke. This type of study can only establish a link between the DHRPS and disease. It can't determine whether a higher score actually causes them.</p>\n        <p>Here are four other limitations of this research to keep in mind:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Participants in this study were likely more willing to monitor their activity and health than the average person. And more than 70% of the study subjects were female and more than 80% were white. The results could have been quite different outside of a research setting and if a more diverse group had been included.</li>\n          <li>The findings were not compared to standard risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as having a strong family history of cardiovascular disease or smoking cigarettes. Nor were DHRPS scores compared with <a href=\"https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-calculator\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">standard risk calculators for cardiovascular disease</a>. So the value of DHRPS compared with other readily available (and free) risk assessments isn't clear.</li>\n          <li>The exercise stress testing findings were based on only 21 people. That's far too few to make definitive conclusions.</li>\n          <li>The cost of a device to continuously monitor heart rate and steps can run in the hundreds of dollars; for many this may be prohibitive, especially since the benefits of calculating the DHRPS are unproven.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>The bottom line</h2>\n        <p>Tracking DHRPS or daily activity and other health measures might be a way to improve your health if the results prompt you to make positive changes in behavior, such as becoming more active. Or perhaps DHRPS could one day help your health care provider monitor your fitness, better assess your health risks, and recommend preventive approaches. But we don't yet know if this new measure will actually lead to improved health because the study didn't explore that.</p>\n        <p>If you already have a device that continuously monitors your daily heart rate and step count, feel free to do the math! Maybe knowing your DHRPS will motivate you to do more to lower your risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Or maybe it won't. We need more research and experience with this measure to know whether it can deliver on its potential to improve health.</p>\n    "

It's extracted from berries that grow on saw palmetto palm trees, which are native to the southeastern United States.</p>\n        <p>By one estimate, more than a third of all US adults who take supplements use saw palmetto specifically. Some evidence suggests that saw palmetto has anti-inflammatory properties, and its use as folk medicine dates back over a century.</p>\n        <p>But experts at Harvard say men should view its supposed benefits for prostate health skeptically. \"Saw palmetto is unlikely to harm you, but it probably won't provide any major benefits either,\" says Dr. Heidi Rayala, an assistant professor of urology at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.</p>\n        <h2>BPH and the potential effect of saw palmetto</h2>\n        <p>It's common for men to develop an enlarged prostate, or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), when they get older. BPH impedes urinary flow through the urethra, causing obstructive symptoms that can worsen with time.</p>\n        <p>Just how saw palmetto might act on the prostate to improve symptoms isn't entirely clear, however. Some evidence suggest it mimics the effects of certain drugs used for treating BPH, including 5-alpha reductase inhibitors such as finasteride (Proscar), which shrink the prostate gland.</p>\n        <p>In the US, no herbal supplement is approved as BPH treatment. The American Urological Association cautions that studies backing saw palmetto for treating enlarged prostates have numerous flaws, including short durations and a lack of placebo controls. Most of the supporting evidence comes from small studies paid for by companies that sell dietary supplements.</p>\n        <h2>What do randomized clinical trials show?</h2>\n        <p>The best-conducted research shows no benefits from saw palmetto for BPH. During <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa053085\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">one study</a>, 225 men with moderate to severe BPH were treated with either a placebo or 160 milligrams (mg) of saw palmetto, taken twice daily for a year. The investigators detected no difference in outcomes, but they also acknowledged that doses tested in the study may have been too low to produce measurable effects.</p>\n        <p>So, during <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3326341/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">a larger subsequent study</a>, researchers tested higher doses of saw palmetto ranging up to 320 mg given three times a day. Nearly 370 men ages 45 and older were randomized to treatment or placebo groups. After year and a half, men in both groups reported feeling either no worse or a little better. Remarkably, 40% of the placebo-treated men said symptoms had improved, suggesting the simple act of taking a pill could have something to do with the supplement's perceived benefits.</p>\n        <p>Dr. Michael Barry, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, led the study. He urges men to consult with their doctors before trying saw palmetto, mainly to rule out other potential causes of urinary obstruction, which can include bladder or prostate cancer. And saw palmetto may interfere with the blood's clotting ability, making it risky for men who take blood thinners.</p>\n        <h2>Recent results and comments</h2>\n        <p>The latest evidence on saw palmetto and BPH comes from a <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37345871/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Cochrane Review</a> of 27 placebo-controlled studies enrolling a combined 4,656 participants. Results published in 2024 showed no improvement in urinary symptoms or quality of life from taking saw palmetto (alone or with other herbal supplements) over durations ranging up to 17 months.</p>\n        <p>\"If the ingredients in these herbal products worked well for urinary symptoms, drug companies would have already had them approved by the FDA as a medicine that insurance companies would have to cover,\" Dr. Rayala said. \"It's okay to take them, but just be cautious about spending too much of your own money on these alternatives.\"</p>\n        <p>\"It is easy to understand why so many find taking a naturally occurring supplement for treating urinary difficulties in middle age appealing,\" said Dr. Marc Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and editor in chief of the <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/annual-report-on-prostate-diseases\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases</em></a>. \"However, evidence of effectiveness with saw palmetto is lacking, and its use for BPH and other common urinary symptoms without a full evaluation of the potential cause should be discouraged.\"</p>\n    "

      "summary": "# 什么是前列腺炎以及如何治疗？\n\n前列腺炎，即前列腺炎症，比人们想象的更为常见，每年约有200万次就诊。其令人困扰的症状包括排尿灼热或疼痛、尿急（尤其是在夜间）、射精疼痛，以及下背部和会阴（阴囊与肛门之间的区域）疼痛。\n\n## 前列腺炎概述\n\n前列腺炎通常分为四种类型：\n\n1.  **急性细菌性前列腺炎**：\n    *   突然发作，常由大肠杆菌等细菌感染引起。\n    *   患者可能出现肌肉酸痛、发烧、精液或尿液带血，以及泌尿生殖系统症状。\n    *   急性炎症可导致前列腺肿胀并阻塞膀胱尿液流出，完全阻塞属于需要立即治疗的医疗急症。\n    *   根据症状严重程度，可能需要住院治疗。\n\n2.  **慢性细菌性前列腺炎**：\n    *   由较轻的感染引起，有时会持续数月。\n    *   在老年男性中更常见，症状通常时轻时重，有时几乎难以察觉。\n\n3.  **慢性非细菌性前列腺炎（CPPS）**：\n    *   最常见的类型，也称为慢性盆腔疼痛综合征。\n    *   可由压力、尿路感染或生殖泌尿区域的物理创伤（导致炎症或神经损伤）触发。\n    *   有些男性病因不明。\n    *   CPPS可影响整个盆底，即所有支持肠道、膀胱和性功能器官的肌肉、神经和组织。\n\n4.  **无症状炎症性前列腺炎**：\n    *   当医生在评估其他疾病时，在男性前列腺组织或分泌物中检测到白细胞时诊断。\n    *   通常无需治疗。\n\n### PSA水平与前列腺炎\n\n急性细菌性前列腺炎和慢性细菌性前列腺炎都可能导致前列腺特异性抗原（PSA）水平飙升。这可能令人担忧，因为高PSA也可能预示前列腺癌。但如果男性患有前列腺炎，那么PSA升高很可能就是由前列腺炎而非前列腺癌引起的。\n\n## 前列腺炎治疗\n\n幸运的是，研究进展为前列腺炎患者带来了令人鼓舞的治疗发展。\n\n### 细菌性前列腺炎的治疗\n\n*   **抗生素**：氟喹诺酮类抗生素对急性和慢性细菌性前列腺炎有效，通常需要4到6周的疗程。然而，细菌对氟喹诺酮的耐药性日益成为一个问题。\n*   **替代药物**：如果其他药物失效，一种较老的药物磷霉素可能有所帮助。\n*   **PSA水平**：治疗后PSA水平会下降，尽管这个过程可能需要三到六个月。\n\n### 慢性非细菌性前列腺炎（CPPS）的治疗\n\n由于CPPS并非由细菌感染引起，因此对抗生素没有反应。\n\n*   **药物治疗**：\n    *   非甾体抗炎药（如布洛芬）。\n    *   α受体阻滞剂（包括坦索罗辛/Flomax），可放松前列腺和膀胱颈部的紧张肌肉。\n    *   PDE5抑制剂（如他达拉非/Cialis），可改善前列腺的血流量。\n*   **专业物理治疗**：\n    *   **触发点疗法**：针对肌肉中紧张和痉挛的敏感区域。\n    *   **肌筋膜放松**：物理治疗师可以减轻肌肉和器官周围结缔组织的张力。\n    *   **注意**：男性应避免凯格尔运动，这会使盆底肌肉收紧并可能加重症状。\n*   **针灸**：在临床试验中显示出前景。一项2023年的研究表明，针灸治疗结束后，CPPS症状在长达六个月内有显著改善。\n*   **整体治疗策略**：越来越多的证据表明，CPPS应采用整体策略治疗，同时考虑心理因素。CPPS患者常伴有抑郁、焦虑和其他精神健康问题，这些问题会加剧疼痛感知。正念和认知行为疗法（CBT）等技术可以帮助CPPS患者制定有效的应对策略。\n\n### 医生建议\n\n贝斯以色列女执事医疗中心泌尿科医生、哈佛医学院外科助理教授Boris Gershman博士指出，鉴于四类前列腺炎的治疗方式不同，准确诊断至关重要。Gershman博士补充说，在治疗细菌性前列腺炎后应重新检测PSA，以确保其恢复正常。如果抗生素治疗后PSA仍升高，或者在非细菌性前列腺炎患者中检测到异常水平，则应“按照标准诊断方法评估PSA”。\n\n![正常前列腺与前列腺炎](https://domf5oio6qrcr.cloudfront.net/medialibrary/16501/gettyimages-947316424.jpg)\n\n*插图显示左侧为正常前列腺，右侧为患有前列腺炎的前列腺，肿大的腺体导致尿道受压。*",

The troubling symptoms include burning or painful urination, an urgent need to go (especially at night), painful ejaculations, and also pain in the lower back and perineum (the space between the scrotum and anus).</p>\n        <h2>Prostatitis overview</h2>\n        <p>There are four general categories of prostatitis:</p>\n        <p><strong>Acute bacterial prostatitis</strong> comes on suddenly and is often caused by infections with bacteria such <em>as Escherichia coli</em> that normally live in the colon. Men can suffer muscle aches, fever, and blood in semen or urine, as well as urogenital symptoms. Acute inflammation can cause the prostate to swell and block urinary outflow from the bladder. A complete blockage is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. Depending on symptom severity, hospitalization may be necessary.</p>\n        <p><strong>Chronic bacterial prostatitis</strong> results from milder infections that sometimes linger for months. It occurs more often in older men and the symptoms typically wax and wane in severity, sometimes becoming barely noticeable.</p>\n        <p><strong>Chronic nonbacterial prostatitis,</strong> also called chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), is the most common type. CPPS can be triggered by stress, urinary tract infections, or physical trauma causing inflammation or nerve damage in the genitourinary area. In some men, the cause is never identified. CPPS can affect the entire pelvic floor, meaning all the muscles, nerves, and tissues that support organs involved in bowel, bladder, and sexual functioning.</p>\n        <p><strong>Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis</strong> is diagnosed when doctors detect white blood cells in prostate tissues or secretions in men being evaluated for other conditions. It generally requires no treatment.</p>\n        <p>Both acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis can cause blood levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to spike. This can be alarming, since high PSA is also indicative of prostate cancer. But if a man has prostatitis, then that condition — and not prostate cancer — may very well be the reason for the rise in PSA.</p>\n        <h2>Prostatitis treatments</h2>\n        <p>Fortunately, research advances are leading to some encouraging developments for men suffering from this condition.</p>\n        <p>Antibiotics called fluoroquinolones are effective treatments for acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis. A four-to six-week course of the drugs typically does the trick. However, bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones is a growing problem. An older drug called fosfomycin can help if other drugs stop working. PSA levels will decline with treatment, although that process may take three to six months.</p>\n        <p>CPPS is treated in other ways. Since it is not caused by a bacterial infection, CPPS will not respond to antibiotics. Medical treatments include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, alpha blockers including tamsulosin (Flomax) that loosen tight muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, and drugs called PDEF inhibitors such as tadalafil (Cialis) that improve blood flow to the prostate.</p>\n        <p>Specialized types of physical therapy can provide some relief. One method called <a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/a-2004-5802.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">trigger point therapy</a>, for instance, targets tender areas in muscles that tighten up and spasm. With another method called <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35389057/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">myofascial release</a>, physical therapists can reduce tension in the connective tissues surrounding muscles and organs. Men should avoid Kegel exercises, however, which can tighten the pelvic floor and cause worsening symptoms.</p>\n        <p>Acupuncture has shown promise in clinical trials. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37313559/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">One study</a> published in 2023 showed significant improvements in CPPS symptoms lasting up to six months after the acupuncture treatments were finished. Mounting evidence suggest that CPPS should be treated with holistic strategies that also consider psychological factors.</p>\n        <p>Men with CPPS often suffer from depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues that can exacerbate pain perception. Techniques such as mindfulness and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38228093/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">cognitive behavioral therapy for CPPS</a> can help CPPS sufferers develop effective coping strategies.</p>\n        <h2>Comment</h2>\n        <p>\"An accurate diagnosis is important given differences in how each of the four categories of prostatitis is treated,\" said Dr. Boris Gershman, a urologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and assistant professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School. PSA should also be retested after treating bacterial forms of prostatitis, Dr. Gershman added, to ensure that the levels go back to normal. If the PSA stays elevated after antibiotic treatment, or if abnormal levels are detected in men with nonbacterial prostatitis, then the PSA \"should be evaluated in accordance with standard diagnostic approaches,\" Dr. Gershman said.</p>\n    "

But it's not recommended for insufficient sleep, poor sleep quality, or difficulty with falling asleep or staying asleep.</li>\n          <li>Is it healthier to be asleep by 10 p.m.? One video that garnered more than a million views claims it is.

An analysis of more than 30 studies showed that roughly <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-abstract/38/6/925/2417000\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">64% of the drug response</a> for a sleep medication in insomnia patients could be due to the placebo effect. A key takeaway is that studies that are not <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6235704/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">randomized controlled trials</a> — such as this small study on 24 people suggesting that <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21669584/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">kiwi fruit</a> may improve sleep — should be interpreted with a grain of salt.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Could you have orthosomnia?</h2>\n        <p>The expectation of flawless sleep, night in and night out, is an unrealistic goal. <a href=\"https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.6472\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Orthosomnia</a> is a term that describes an unhealthy pursuit of perfect sleep. The pressure to get perfect sleep is embedded in the sleepmaxxing culture.</p>\n        <p>With more and more people able to access daily data about their sleep and other health metrics through <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/topics/1556/wearable-technology/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">consumer wearables</a>, even a person who is objectively sleeping well can become unnecessarily concerned with optimizing their sleep. While prioritizing restful sleep is commendable, setting perfection as your goal is problematic. Even <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15402002.2017.1376205\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">good sleepers</a> vary from night to night, experiencing less than desirable sleep a couple of times per week.</p>\n        <p>It is also noteworthy that some of the most widely viewed recommendations on TikTok are not supported by scientific evidence.</p>\n        <h2>Do you really need to fix your sleep?</h2>\n        <p>A good first step is to understand whether or not there is anything that you need to fix! Consider tracking your sleep for a few weeks using a <a href=\"https://sleepeducation.org/resources/sleep-diary/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">sleep diary</a>, and pair this data with a consumer wearable (such as a Fitbit or Apple Watch). Both <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/20/6532\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">imperfectly capture sleep data</a> when compared to the gold-standard tool sleep experts use (<a href=\"https://sleep.hms.harvard.edu/education-training/public-education/sleep-and-health-education-program/sleep-health-education-33\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">polysomnography</a>, or a sleep study). However, combining the information can give you a reasonable assessment of your sleep status.</p>\n        <p>Regularly getting restful sleep can indeed boost health and mood. And all of us can benefit from following basic sleep hygiene tips. But if it takes you 30 minutes or more to fall asleep, or if you are up for 30 minutes or more in the middle of the night, and this happens three or more times per week, then consider reaching out to your health care team to seek further evaluation.</p>\n        <p>There are effective, nonmedication treatments that are proven to help you sleep better. One example is <a href=\"https://sleep.hms.harvard.edu/education-training/public-education/sleep-and-health-education-program/sleep-health-education-64\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia</a>, which can dramatically improve insomnia symptoms in a matter of weeks.</p>\n        <p>\n          <em>Want to learn more about cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia?

Caregivers — usually partners, family members, or close friends — play crucial roles in supporting a patient's physical and psychological well-being. But what does that entail? You as a caregiver might not know what to say or how to help.</p>\n        <p>\"Patients diagnosed with advanced cancer are facing their own mortality,\" says Dr. Marc Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and editor in chief of the <em>Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases</em>. \"And they each process that in different ways.\"</p>\n        <p>Dr. Garnick emphasizes the need provide patients and families with the best information possible about the specifics of the diagnosis, symptoms, and available treatments. Some patients have near-miraculous responses to treatment, he says, even when they have very advanced cancer. \"We let patients know that there are reasons to be optimistic, as treatments are improving on a regular basis,\" he says.</p>\n        <h2>Communication</h2>\n        <p>Dr. Garnick points out that clinicians should avoid words or phrases that can leave cancer patients feeling unempowered. A phrase like \"Let's not worry about that now,\" for instance, is dismissive and doesn't respond to a patient's legitimate concerns. Saying \"You're lucky your cancer is only stage 2\" doesn't allow for the fear and anxiety a patient may have over his disease.</p>\n        <p>Along similar lines, \"It's important for caregivers to be receptive to what their loved ones are saying,\" Dr. Garnick says. \"Instead of minimizing or questioning what your loved one is telling you, try asking 'What do you need? Tell me what you think is going to help you feel better.'\"</p>\n        <p>While it's natural to offer reassurance, you should also give your loved one space to express himself openly without offering quick solutions. Be aware that treatment can lead to emotional ups and downs, so expect mood fluctuations.</p>\n        <p>One of the most valuable tools you have as a caregiver is the relationship you've built with your loved one over the years. During this challenging time, remind yourself of the bonds you've created together. Shared memories, inside jokes, and mutual interests can provide strength and comfort.</p>\n        <h2>Day-to-day practical support</h2>\n        <p>Managing medications can be challenging. Cancer patients can take a dozen or more pills per day on varying schedules. You can help your loved one stay on track by setting up a pill organizer (available at most drugstores) that sorts medications according to when they're needed.</p>\n        <p>Patients with advanced prostate cancer are now being treated more often with drug combinations that include chemotherapy as well as hormonal therapies. Chemotherapy can leave patients feeling unusually cold, and patients may also get cold after experiencing hot flashes from hormonal therapy. So keep lots of blankets and warm hats on hand.</p>\n        <p>Collaborate on a journal where you and your loved one keep health information in one place. It should contain the names and contacts of clinicians on his team, as well as details of his treatment plan. The journal can also double as a diary where you both record treatment experiences.</p>\n        <p>You might be tasked with coordinating medical appointments. It's important to keep lists of questions you may have. Take notes so you have a record of what doctors and other people on his care team have told you. Also, you should take some time to familiarize yourself with your loved one's insurance policies or Medicare plans so you have a better understanding of what's covered.</p>\n        <h2>Don't forget to take care of yourself!</h2>\n        <p>As a caregiver, it's easy to get lost in your loved one's needs. But caring for someone with cancer while managing household responsibilities can also leave you feeling isolated, burned out, and even depressed. It's essential to also prioritize your own health and well-being.</p>\n        <p>Make sure that you get enough sleep and exercise. Keep up with your own checkups and screening. Try to eat well, and prepare meals ahead of time to reduce stress and save time on busy days. Take breaks! Caregiving can be intense, so take time to recharge by taking a walk, reading a book, or spending time with friends.</p>\n        <p>Here are some valuable resources that can help.</p>\n        <p><a href=\"http://www.helpforcancercaregivers.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Help for Cancer Caregivers</a> provides support on managing feelings and emotions, keeping healthy, day-to-day needs, working together, and long-distance caregiving.</p>\n        <p>The <a href=\"http://www.pcf.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Prostate Cancer Foundation</a> provides an array of educational materials, including a \"caregiver's toolkit\" that helps caregivers understand treatment options, side effects, and ways to be actively involved in the decision-making process.</p>\n        <p>The <a href=\"http://www.patientadvocate.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Patient Advocate Foundation</a> offers case management services to help caregivers and patients understand insurance coverage, financial assistance programs, and other resources that can reduce the financial burden of cancer treatment.</p>\n    "

It affects approximately 7% to 8% of all children and youth in the US. As the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) points out in their <a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/144/4/e20192528\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">clinical practice guideline for ADHD</a>, that's more than the mental health system can handle, which means that pediatricians need to step up and help out.</p>\n        <p>So, if your child is having problems with attention, focus, hyperactivity, impulsivity, or some combination of those, and is at least 4 years old, your first step should be an appointment with your child's primary care doctor.</p>\n        <h2 class=\"Subhead\">What steps will your pediatrician take?</h2>\n        <p>According to the AAP, here's what your doctor should do:</p>\n        <p><strong>Take a history.</strong> Your doctor should ask you lots of questions about what is going on. Be ready to give details and examples.</p>\n        <p><strong>Ask you to fill out a questionnaire about your child.</strong> Your doctor should also give you a questionnaire to give to your child's teacher or guidance counselor.</p>\n        <p>A diagnosis of ADHD is made only if a child has symptoms that are</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>present in more than one setting: For most children, that would be both home and school. If symptoms are only present in one setting, it's less likely to be ADHD and more likely to be related to that setting. For example, a child who only has problems at school may have a learning disability.</li>\n          <li>causing a problem in both of those settings: If a child is active and/or easily distracted, but is getting good grades, isn't causing problems in class, and has good relationships in school and at home, there is not a problem. It bears watching, but it could be just personality or temperament.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>There are ADHD rating scales that have been studied and shown to be reliable, such as the <a href=\"https://www.nichq.org/resource/nichq-vanderbilt-assessment-scales\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Vanderbilt</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/conners-scale#1\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Conners</a> assessments. These scales can be very helpful, not just in making diagnoses, but also in following the progress of a child over time.</p>\n        <p><strong>Screen your child for other problems.</strong> There are problems that can mimic ADHD, such as learning disabilities, depression, or even hearing problems. Additionally, children who have ADHD can also have learning disabilities, depression, or substance use. It's important to ask enough questions and get enough information to be sure.</p>\n        <h2 class=\"Subhead\">Discussing treatment options for ADHD</h2>\n        <p>If a diagnosis of ADHD is made, your pediatrician should discuss treatment options with you.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>For 4- and 5-year-olds:</strong> The best place to begin is really with parent training on managing behavior, and getting support in the classroom. Medications should only be considered in this age group if those interventions don't help, and the child's symptoms are causing significant problems.</li>\n          <li><strong>For 6- to 12-year-olds:</strong> Along with parent training and behavioral support, medications can be very helpful. Primary care providers can prescribe one of the FDA-approved medications for ADHD (stimulants, atomoxetine, guanfacine, or clonidine). In this age group, formal classroom support in the form of an <a href=\"https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/special-services/ieps/understanding-individualized-education-programs\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Individualized Education Program</a> (IEP) or a <a href=\"https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/special-services/504-plan/understanding-504-plans\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">504 plan</a> should be in place.</li>\n          <li><strong>For 12- to 18-year-olds:</strong> The same school programs and behavioral health support should be in place. Medications can be helpful, but teens should be part of that decision process; shared decision-making is an important part of caring for teens, and for getting them ready to take on their own care when they become adults.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2 class=\"Subhead\">Follow-up care for a child with ADHD</h2>\n        <p>Your pediatrician also should follow up with you and your child. Early on, there should be frequent visits while you figure out the diagnosis, as well as any other possible problems. And if medication is prescribed, frequent visits are needed initially as you figure out the best medication and dose and monitor for side effects.</p>\n        <p>After that, the frequency of the visits will depend on how things are going, but appointments should be regular and scheduled, not just made to respond to a problem. ADHD can be a lifelong problem, bringing different challenges at different times, and it's important that you, your child, and your doctor meet regularly so that you can best meet those challenges.</p>\n        <p>Because together, you can.</p>\n        <p>Watch a video of Dr. Erica Lee discussing behavioral therapies to help children with ADHD.</p>\n        <div class=\"iframe-wrapper\">\n          <p>\n            <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gcU2TQz3dzU?si=maBsk6y6l_iZhTta\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\"></iframe>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n    "

Salud! Prost!</em>\n        </p>\n        <p>Drinking to one's health is a common tradition. But it may also be self-defeating: the alcohol that's part of many toasts can actually harm your health.</p>\n        <p>Of course, alcohol consumption extends well past toasts. For millions of people, it's a regular part of the dining experience, social and sports events, celebrations, and milestones. Alcohol plays a key role in many religious traditions. And the alcoholic beverage industry is a major economic force, responsible for more than $250 billion in sales annually in the US.</p>\n        <p>But there are many downsides to drinking: some are likely familiar (spoiler alert: it's not great for your liver) while others are less well appreciated. And concerns about the risks of even moderate drinking are on the rise.</p>\n        <h2>The negative effects of alcohol</h2>\n        <p>Here are some of the most common problems associated with alcohol consumption (especially if excessive):</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>liver disease, including cirrhosis and life-threatening liver failure requiring a liver transplant</li>\n          <li>a higher risk of high blood pressure, heart failure, and dementia</li>\n          <li>an increased risk of cancer (more on this below)</li>\n          <li>a higher risk of injury, especially from drunk driving and falls (homicides and suicides are also often alcohol-related)</li>\n          <li>lapses in judgment — for example, people who are drunk may engage in risky sexual behavior or use other drugs</li>\n          <li>an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and addiction: these problems may impact one's ability to establish and maintain social relationships and employment</li>\n          <li>fetal alcohol syndrome: alcohol can damage a baby's developing brain and cause other developmental abnormalities</li>\n          <li>alcohol poisoning: many people don't realize that if you drink enough alcohol over a short period of time, it can be fatal.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Heavy drinking can also cause problems well beyond the health of the drinker — it can damage important relationships. It's all too common that problem drinking disrupts bonds with a spouse, family members, friends, coworkers, or employers.</p>\n        <h2>Alcohol and cancer: A growing concern</h2>\n        <p>In recent decades, a number of studies have <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37905315/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">linked drinking to higher rates of cancer</a>, including cancers involving the</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>liver</li>\n          <li>colon</li>\n          <li>breast</li>\n          <li>mouth</li>\n          <li>throat and esophagus.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>In many cases, even moderate drinking (defined below) appears to increase risk. Despite this, <a href=\"https://www.aicr.org/news/survey-finds-alarming-gaps-in-americans-knowledge-of-major-cancer-risk-factors/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">less than half of the US public</a> is aware of any alcohol-cancer connection. That's why the Surgeon General <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/alcohol-cancer/index.html\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">issued an advisory in January 2025</a> recommending that alcoholic beverages carry new labels warning of the alcohol-cancer link and highlighting that <a href=\"https://www.who.int/europe/news-room/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">no safe low level of alcohol consumption has been established</a>. Changing the labels as suggested by the Surgeon General will require congressional action that may never happen.</p>\n        <p>Current alcoholic beverage labels in the US warn of the risks of driving under the influence of alcohol, adverse effects on general health, and risks for a developing fetus — but there's no mention of cancer.</p>\n        <h2>Are there any health benefits to drinking alcohol?</h2>\n        <p>Alcohol has long been considered a \"social lubricant\" because drinking may encourage social interaction. Having a drink while getting together with family or friends is often part of many special occasions.</p>\n        <p>And not so long ago there was general consensus that drinking in moderation also came with health advantages, including a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. More recently, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37000449/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">this belief has been called into question</a>.</p>\n        <p>Even among the positive studies, potential health benefits are often quite small. In addition, alcohol may reduce the risk of one condition (such as cardiovascular disease) while increasing the risk of another (such as cancer). So it's hard to predict who might actually benefit and who may be harmed more than helped by alcohol consumption. And the balance of risk and benefit likely varies from person to person, based on individual factors such as genetics and lifestyle factors.</p>\n        <h2>Is drinking some alcohol better than drinking none?</h2>\n        <p>A number of studies suggest the answer may be yes. For example, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29920516/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">a 2018 study</a> found that light drinkers (those consuming one to three drinks per week) had lower rates of cancer or death than those drinking less than one drink per week or none at all.</p>\n        <p>More recent studies (all published in 2023) came to similar conclusions. For example:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>A study of nearly a million people followed for more than 12 years found that <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38000378/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">abstainers had higher rates of death and chronic disease</a> (including cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and chronic lung disease) than light or moderate drinkers.</li>\n          <li>Researchers reporting on more than half a million people found that <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37286970/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">nondrinkers had higher rates of death than moderate drinkers</a>.</li>\n          <li>An analysis combining findings from 22 prior studies concluded that people who drank wine <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37375690/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">had lower rates of cardiovascular disease and related death</a> than those who did not.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>By contrast, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37000449/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">another 2023 study</a> found similar rates of death between nondrinkers and light to moderate drinkers.</p>\n        <p>It's worth noting that current guidelines advise <em>against</em> drinking alcohol as a way to improve health.</p>\n        <h2>How much alcohol is too much?</h2>\n        <p>The answer to this important question has varied over time, but <a href=\"https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/alcohol/info\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">current US guidelines</a> recommend that men who drink should limit intake to two drinks/day or less and women who drink should have no more than one drink/day. The definitions for a drink in the US are the common serving sizes for beer (12 ounces), wine (5 ounces), or distilled spirits/hard liquor (1.5 ounces).</p>\n        <p>A number of experts have recommended revision of the guidelines toward lower amounts, as <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11320169/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">more studies</a> have linked even moderate alcohol consumption to health risks. Predictably, the alcoholic beverage industry opposes more restrictive guidelines.</p>\n        <p>Of course, no one needs to wait for new guidelines or warning labels to curb their drinking. Many are <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/feel-like-you-should-be-drinking-less-start-here-202409273073\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">exploring ways to cut back</a>, including the <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/thinking-of-trying-dry-january-steps-for-success-202201032662\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Dry January Challenge</a> or alcohol-free drinks.</p>\n        <h2>What we don't know: The significant limitations of alcohol-related health research</h2>\n        <p>Nearly all large studies regarding alcohol's impact on health assess associations, not causation. So a higher rate of certain cancers may be associated with more alcohol consumption, but that doesn't prove alcohol caused the cancer.</p>\n        <p>In addition, most rely on self-reporting that may be inaccurate, do not analyze binge drinking, do not assess alcohol consumption over a lifetime, or do not account for the fact that some study subjects may change their alcohol consumption due to alcohol-related health problems. These limitations make it hard to know how much to rely on studies that find health risks (or benefits) to alcohol consumption.</p>\n        <h2>The bottom line</h2>\n        <p>Assessing the risks and benefits of alcohol consumption remains an active area of research that may lead to major changes in official guidelines or warning labels.</p>\n        <p>But here's one thing that hasn't changed: many people like to drink. Even with more restrictive guidelines or new warning labels, it's likely that plenty of folks will accept the risks of drinking alcohol. Still, it's important to know what those risks are.</p>\n        <p>So, stay tuned. You can expect to hear about more research, debate, and controversy in the near future regarding the potential risks and benefits of drinking, and how much — if any — is ideal.</p>\n    "

Wondering how to spend that time? Given how tiring holidays can be&nbsp;— especially for parents who are working&nbsp;— it's understandable why children are often allowed to spend hours with the TV, tablet, or video games. After all, happy, quiet kids make for happy parents who can finally get stuff done — or relax.</p>\n        <p>Except kids are spending way too much time in front of screens. According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, kids ages 8 to 12 are spending <a href=\"https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Children-And-Watching-TV-054.aspx#:~:text=Screen%20Time%20and%20Children&amp;text=Children%20and%20adolescents%20spend%20a,spend%20up%20to%209%20hours.\" target=\"_blank\">four to six hours a day watching or using screens</a> — and tweens and teens are spending nine hours.</p>\n        <p>Given how enticing devices and social media can be, those numbers can easily go higher during unscheduled times like weekends and school vacation. That's why it's good to be proactive and come up with other activities. Below are some ideas for parents and caregivers to try. These are mostly good for kids through elementary school, but tweens and teens may enjoy some of them too.</p>\n        <h2 class=\"Subhead\">\n          <strong>Spending time off the screen</strong>\n        </h2>\n        <p><strong>Go outside.</strong> This sounds obvious, but spending time outdoors is something kids do less than they used to — and it can be really fun. If you have a yard, go out into it and play hide-and-seek or build a fort from snow or anything else that's around. If you don't have a yard, go to a local park or just go for a walk. A scavenger hunt up and down the block or game of I Spy may be a good enticement.</p>\n        <p><strong>Go to the library.</strong> Do this early on in vacation, so that your child has lots of books, puzzles, and games to pass the time. Check out as many as they allow and you can carry. Ask if a Library of Things is available at a branch near you: crafts, tools, musical instruments, birding kits, telescopes — even metal detectors may be checked out for free.</p>\n        <p><strong>Build a fort in the living room.</strong> Use blankets or sheets over chairs; if you have a small tent, set it up. Bring in pillows, sleeping bags, and flashlights; let the kids sleep in it at night. Let it stay up all vacation.</p>\n        <p><strong>Build a city in the living room.</strong> Use blocks, Legos, boxes (or anything else), and add roads, cars, people, animals, trains, and other toys. Let it stay up all vacation, and make it bigger every day.</p>\n        <h2 class=\"Subhead\">\n          <strong>Getting creative off the screen</strong>\n        </h2>\n        <p><strong>Get creative.</strong> Go to the craft store and stock up on inexpensive supplies. Buy things like poster board, huge pieces of paper (you could use those for your city, too, to make parks, roads, and parking lots), paints, and markers. You can make a paper mural, a comic book, a story, posters, or whatever catches your child's imagination. If you know how to knit or sew, think about teaching your child or making a simple project together.&nbsp; Play music while you create.</p>\n        <p><strong>Read out loud.</strong> There are so many books that are fun to read aloud. When my children were younger, we read the Harry Potter series out loud, as well as the Chronicles of Narnia and books by E.B. White and Roald Dahl. Act out the voices. Have some fun.</p>\n        <p><strong>Have a puppet show.</strong> If you don't have puppets, you can make some with socks — or you can hold up dolls or action figures and do the talking for them. You can make a makeshift stage by cutting out the back of a box and taping cloth (like a pillowcase) to fall over the front.</p>\n        <p><strong>Get out the games.</strong> There are so many that work across the ages, like checkers, chess, Uno, Connect 4, Sorry, Twister, Clue, Scrabble, or Monopoly. We forget how much fun these can be.</p>\n        <p><strong>Bake.</strong> You don't have to get fancy — it's fine to use mixes or pre-made cookie dough. There's nothing better than baked goods straight from the oven, and adding frosting and decorations makes it even more fun. Turn on music and dance while things bake.</p>\n        <p>While parents or caregivers need to be involved with some of these activities (like the ones involving the oven, or reading out loud), kids can do many of them independently once you have it started. Which, really, is what children need: time to use their imagination and just play.</p>\n        <p>But you just may find that once you have things started, you'll want to play, too.</p>\n    "

Much of it is well-deserved. After all, <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/inflammation-a-unifying-theory-of-disease\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">long-term inflammation contributes to chronic illnesses</a> and deaths. If you just relied on headlines for health information, you might think that stamping out inflammation would eliminate cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia, and perhaps aging itself.</p>\n        <p>Unfortunately, that's not true.</p>\n        <p>Still, our understanding of how chronic inflammation can impair health has expanded dramatically in recent years. And with this understanding come three common questions: Could I have inflammation without knowing it? How can I find out if I do? Are there tests for inflammation? Indeed, there are.</p>\n        <h2>Testing for inflammation</h2>\n        <p>A number of well-established tests to detect inflammation are commonly used in medical care. But it's important to note these tests can't distinguish between <em>acute</em> inflammation, which might develop with a cold, pneumonia, or an injury, and the more damaging <em>chronic</em> inflammation that may accompany diabetes, obesity, or an autoimmune disease, among other conditions. Understanding <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/why-all-the-buzz-about-inflammation-and-just-how-bad-is-it-202203162705\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">the difference between acute and chronic inflammation</a> is important.</p>\n        <p>These are four of the most common tests for inflammation:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (sed rate or ESR).</strong> This test measures how fast red blood cells settle to the bottom of a vertical tube of blood. When inflammation is present the red blood cells fall faster, as higher amounts of proteins in the blood make those cells clump together. While ranges vary by lab, a normal result is typically 20 mm/hr or less, while a value over 100 mm/hr is quite high.</li>\n          <li><strong>C-reactive protein (CRP).</strong> This protein made in the liver tends to rise when inflammation is present. A normal value is less than 3 mg/L. A value over 3 mg/L is often used to identify an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but bodywide inflammation can make CRP rise to 100 mg/L or more.</li>\n          <li><strong>Ferritin.</strong> This is a blood protein that reflects the amount of iron stored in the body. It's most often ordered to evaluate whether an anemic person is iron-deficient, in which case ferritin levels are low. Or, if there is too much iron in the body, ferritin levels may be high. But ferritin levels also rise when inflammation is present. Normal results vary by lab and tend to be a bit higher in men, but a typical normal range is 20 to 200 mcg/L.</li>\n          <li><strong>Fibrinogen.</strong> While this protein is most commonly measured to evaluate the status of the blood clotting system, its levels tend to rise when inflammation is present. A normal fibrinogen level is 200 to 400 mg/dL.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Are tests for inflammation useful?</h2>\n        <p>In certain situations, tests to measure inflammation can be quite helpful.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Diagnosing an inflammatory condition.</strong> One example of this is a rare condition called <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30952412/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">giant cell arteritis</a>, in which the ESR is nearly always elevated. If symptoms such as new, severe headache and jaw pain suggest that a person may have this disease, an elevated ESR can increase the suspicion that the disease is present, while a normal ESR argues against this diagnosis.</li>\n          <li><strong>Monitoring an inflammatory condition.</strong> When someone has <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34951925/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, for example, ESR or CRP (or both tests) help determine how active the disease is and how well treatment is working.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>None of these tests is perfect. Sometimes false negative results occur when inflammation actually is present. False positive results may occur when abnormal test results suggest inflammation even when none is present.</p>\n        <h2>Should you be routinely tested for inflammation?</h2>\n        <p>Currently, tests of inflammation are not a part of routine medical care for all adults, and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29998297/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">expert guidelines</a> do not recommend them.</p>\n        <p>CRP testing to assess cardiac risk is encouraged to help decide whether preventive treatment is appropriate for some people (such as those with a risk of a heart attack that is intermediate — that is, neither high nor low). However, for most people evidence suggests that routine CRP testing adds relatively little to assessment using standard risk factors, such as a history of hypertension, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol, and positive family history of heart disease.</p>\n        <p>So far, only one group I know of recommends routine testing for inflammation for all without a specific reason: companies selling inflammation tests directly to consumers.</p>\n        <h2>Inflammation may be silent — so why not test?</h2>\n        <p>It's true that chronic inflammation may not cause specific symptoms. But looking for evidence of inflammation through a blood test without any sense of why it might be there is much less helpful than having routine health care that screens for common causes of silent inflammation, including</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35196429/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">excess weight</a>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39000211/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">diabetes</a>\n          </li>\n          <li><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38774746/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">cardiovascular disease</a> (including heart attacks and stroke)</li>\n          <li><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36674897/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">hepatitis C</a> and other chronic infections</li>\n          <li><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39372419/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">autoimmune disease</a>.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Standard medical evaluation for most of these conditions does not require testing for inflammation. And your medical team can recommend the right treatments if you do have one of these conditions.</p>\n        <h2>The bottom line</h2>\n        <p>Testing for inflammation has its place in medical evaluation, and in monitoring certain health conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. But it's not clearly helpful as a routine test for everyone. A better approach is to adopt healthy habits and get routine medical care that can identify and treat the conditions that contribute to harmful inflammation.</p>\n    "

      "summary": "# 乳糜泻：探究四大误区\n\n乳糜泻是一种消化和免疫系统疾病，会阻碍身体吸收必需的营养。尽管对乳糜泻的认识在过去几十年中有所发展，但仍有许多方面未被充分理解，导致公众中普遍存在误解。例如，许多人认为所有乳糜泻患者都会出现腹痛、腹胀或腹泻，但实际上，许多新诊断的成年患者并没有这些症状。此外，麸质（小麦、大麦、黑麦等谷物中的粘性蛋白质）也会在非乳糜泻患者中引起胃肠道不适及其他症状。\n\n![Gluten-free bread & bagels with 12 appetizing toppings like avocado & olives, hummus & chickpeas, sliced hardboiled eggs & greens; concept is celiac disease](https://domf5oio6qrcr.cloudfront.net/medialibrary/15838/gettyimages-1135309751.jpg)\n\n以下是关于乳糜泻及相关消化疾病的四大常见误区及其事实：\n\n## 误区一：乳糜泻通常在幼年诊断\n\n**事实：** 并非如此。虽然乳糜泻可能在婴儿首次接触麸质后随时发展，但通常在生命后期才被诊断出来。根据美国国家乳糜泻协会的数据，平均诊断年龄在46至56岁之间，约25%的人在60岁后才被诊断。乳糜泻在女性中以及患有其他自身免疫疾病（如1型糖尿病、桥本甲状腺炎、疱疹样皮炎）的人群中更为常见。医生认为，某种生理或情感压力（如病毒感染、手术或生活事件带来的焦虑）可能会“触发”疾病的出现。越来越多的中年和老年人被诊断出乳糜泻，通常是在他们被发现患有因营养缺乏引起的贫血或骨质疏松等疾病之后。\n\n## 误区二：乳糜泻只影响肠道\n\n**事实：** 当乳糜泻患者摄入麸质时，会引发免疫系统攻击小肠内壁。健康的小肠内壁有指状突起，称为绒毛，负责吸收营养。在乳糜泻中，免疫系统攻击绒毛，导致它们扁平化和发炎，从而无法充分吸收营养。虽然胃肠道问题可能发生，但并非总是存在。事实上，乳糜泻可以表现出许多不同的症状，影响神经系统、内分泌系统和骨骼系统。例如，可能出现脑雾、月经周期改变或肌肉关节疼痛。\n\n## 误区三：乳糜泻与麸质不耐受相同\n\n**事实：** 如果您在食用麸质后感到不适，这并不一定意味着您患有乳糜泻。有些人患有非乳糜泻麸质敏感（也称为麸质不耐受），这也会在食用麸质后引起不适的消化道症状。但麸质不耐受与乳糜泻不同。乳糜泻通过血液检测特定抗体来诊断，如果抗体存在，则需要进行肠道活检以寻找特征性的损伤迹象来确诊。非乳糜泻麸质敏感不会引发抗体，也不会导致肠道损伤。然而，一些患有此问题的人表示，他们在食用含麸质食物后也会出现脑雾、注意力不集中、肌肉酸痛和疲劳。非乳糜泻麸质敏感似乎是一种真实存在的现象，但其定义尚不明确。目前尚不清楚患者是对麸质本身还是含麸质食物中的其他成分不耐受。一种可能性是FODMAPs（可发酵低聚糖、双糖、单糖和多元醇）等糖类分子，它们存在于许多食物中（包括小麦），当肠道细菌以FODMAPs为食时，会产生气体和腹胀。另一种可能性是对小麦过敏，这可能导致食用小麦后出现口腔和喉咙肿胀、瘙痒或刺激等症状，其他症状还包括皮疹、鼻塞、头痛以及痉挛、恶心和呕吐，少数人甚至可能出现危及生命的过敏反应——过敏性休克。\n\n## 误区四：无麸质饮食总能缓解乳糜泻的症状和体征\n\n**事实：** 乳糜泻的唯一治疗方法——采用避免所有含麸质食物的饮食——并非总能奏效。这个问题被称为“无反应性乳糜泻”。约20%的乳糜泻患者尽管尽力坚持无麸质饮食，但症状仍持续存在。另一些人则会出现间歇性症状，尤其是在意外接触麸质时。意外接触通常发生在人们食用声称无麸质但实际并非如此的预制食品或餐馆食物时，或者通过与含麸质食物的交叉污染。目前正在研究解决无反应性乳糜泻的潜在方案。三个有前景的方法包括：\n\n1.  **分解麸质的酶：** 患者可以在食用含麸质食物的同时服用，其概念类似于乳糖不耐受者服用乳糖酶片来帮助消化乳制品。\n2.  **抑制免疫反应：** 通过抑制一种名为组织转谷氨酰胺酶的酶来减弱对麸质的免疫反应，该酶会使麸质作为抗原更具效力。\n3.  **重编程免疫反应：** 阻止身体对麸质产生反应。",

One example? Many people assume that everyone who has celiac disease is plagued by abdominal pain, bloating, or diarrhea. But actually, many adults newly diagnosed with this inherited gluten intolerance don't have these symptoms.</p>\n        <p>What's more, gluten — the sticky protein found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye — can cause gastrointestinal distress and other symptoms in people who <em>don't</em> have celiac disease. Read on for a deeper dive into four myths and facts about celiac disease and related digestive conditions.</p>\n        <h2>Myth # 1: Celiac disease is usually diagnosed at a young age</h2>\n        <p>Not typically. While celiac disease can develop any time after a baby's first exposure to gluten, it's usually diagnosed <a href=\"https://nationalceliac.org/celiac-disease-questions/can-you-get-celiac-disease-at-any-age/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">much later in life</a>. According to the National Celiac Association, the average age of diagnosis is between 46 and 56. Around 25% of people are diagnosed after age 60.</p>\n        <p>Celiac disease is slightly more common in women and among people with other autoimmune conditions, including type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis (a common cause of low thyroid levels), and dermatitis herpetiformis (a rare condition marked by an itchy, blistering rash).</p>\n        <p>\"We don't know why some people go from being susceptible to actually having celiac disease,\" says Dr. Kelly. The prevailing theory is that some sort of physical or emotional stress — such as a viral infection, surgery, or anxiety from a stressful life event — may \"flip the switch\" and cause the disease to appear, he says. \"Increasing numbers of people are being diagnosed at midlife and older, often after they're found to have conditions such as anemia or osteoporosis caused by nutrient deficiencies,\" says Dr. Kelly.</p>\n        <h2>Myth #2: Celiac disease only affects the gut</h2>\n        <p>When people have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune system attack that can ravage the lining of the small intestine. A healthy small intestine is lined with fingerlike projections, called villi, that absorb nutrients. In celiac disease, the immune system attacks the villi, causing them to flatten and become inflamed — and thus unable to adequately absorb nutrients.</p>\n        <p>While gastrointestinal problems can occur, they aren't always present. In fact, celiac disease can present with <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/common-celiac-disease-symptoms\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">many different symptoms</a> that affect the nervous, endocrine, and skeletal systems. A few examples are brain fog, changes in menstrual periods, or muscle and joint pain.</p>\n        <h2>Myth # 3: Celiac disease versus gluten intolerance</h2>\n        <p>If you feel sick after eating gluten, you probably have celiac disease, right? Actually, that may not be true. Some people have non-celiac gluten sensitivity (also called gluten intolerance), which can cause uncomfortable digestive symptoms after eating gluten. But gluten intolerance differs from celiac disease.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Celiac disease is diagnosed with blood tests that look for specific antibodies. If antibodies are present, a definitive diagnosis requires an intestinal biopsy to look for signs of damage that characterize the condition.</li>\n          <li>Non-celiac gluten sensitivity does not trigger antibodies or cause intestinal damage. Yet some people with this problem say they also experience brain fog, trouble concentrating, muscle aches and pain, and fatigue after eating gluten-containing foods.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>\"Non-celiac gluten sensitivity appears to be a real phenomenon, but it's not well defined,\" says Dr. Kelly. It's unclear whether people experiencing it are intolerant to gluten or to something else in gluten-containing foods.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>One possibility is sugarlike molecules known as <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/should-you-stop-eating-fodmaps\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">FODMAPs</a>, which are found in many foods — including wheat. Short for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, gas and bloating can occur when gut bacteria feed on FODMAPs.</li>\n          <li>Another possibility is an allergy to wheat, which can cause symptoms such as swelling, itching, or irritation of the mouth and throat after eating wheat. Other symptoms include a skin rash, stuffy nose, and headache, as well as cramps, nausea, and vomiting. Some people may develop a life-threating allergic reaction known as <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/anaphylaxis-a-to-z\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">anaphylaxis</a>.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Myth #4: A gluten-free diet always relieves the symptoms and signs of celiac disease</h2>\n        <p>The sole treatment for celiac disease — adopting a <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/celiac-disease-diet-avoiding-foods-that-contain-gluten\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">diet that avoids all gluten-containing foods</a> — doesn't always help. This problem is known as nonresponsive celiac disease.</p>\n        <p>\"About 20% of people with celiac disease have ongoing symptoms, despite their best efforts to stick to a gluten-free diet,\" says Dr. Kelly. Others have intermittent signs and symptoms, particularly when they are accidentally exposed to gluten. Accidental exposures often happen when people eat prepared or restaurant foods that claim to be gluten-free but are not. Cross contamination with gluten-containing foods is another potential route.</p>\n        <p>Potential solutions to nonresponsive celiac disease are being studied. Three promising approaches are:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Enzymes that break down gluten, which people could take alongside gluten-containing foods. \"It's a similar concept to the lactase pills taken by people who are lactose intolerant to help them digest dairy products,\" says Dr. Kelly.</li>\n          <li>Dampening the immune response to gluten by inhibiting an enzyme called tissue transglutaminase that makes gluten more potent as an antigen.</li>\n          <li>Reprogramming the immune response to prevent the body from reacting to gluten.</li>\n        </ul>\n    "

      "shortSummary": "感恩不仅能增进健康和幸福，一项新研究还表明它可能延长寿命。这项针对近五万名老年女性护士的研究发现，感恩程度高的参与者在四年内的死亡风险降低了9%。尽管是观察性研究，但结果在控制其他因素后依然成立。研究者认为，感恩可能通过提升幸福感、促进健康行为和增强社会支持来发挥作用。感恩是一种简单易行的实践，对个人福祉具有有意义的积极影响。",

Each member shares several things for which they're grateful — an act that VanderWeele, co-director of the Initiative on Health, Spirituality, and Religion at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, feels changes his family dynamic for the better.</p>\n        <p>\"I do think it makes a difference and can be a very powerful practice,\" he says. \"Even on those bad days where life seems difficult, that effort is worthwhile.\"</p>\n        <h2>Gratitude, health, and longevity</h2>\n        <p>How can the power of gratitude affect our lives? Recent research has pointed to gratitude's myriad positive health effects, including greater <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886920302907?via%3Dihub\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">emotional and social well-being</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2019.1651888\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">better sleep quality</a>, <a href=\"https://www.clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijda/international-journal-of-depression-and-anxiety-ijda-4-024.php?jid=ijda\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">lower depression risks</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2020.1716054\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">favorable markers of cardiovascular health</a>. Now, new data from the long-term Nurses' Health Study shows that it may extend lives.</p>\n        <p>\"Gratitude has been one of the most widely studied activities contributing to well-being, but we couldn't find a single prior study that looked at its effects on mortality and longevity, much to our surprise,\" says VanderWeele, co-author of the new research.</p>\n        <h2>What did the study look at?</h2>\n        <p>Published July 2024 in <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em>, the new <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2820770\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> drew on data from 49,275 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. Their average age was 79. In 2016, participants completed a six-item gratitude questionnaire in which they ranked their agreement with statements such as, \"I have so much in life to be thankful for,\" and \"If I had to list everything I felt grateful for, it would be a very long list.\"</p>\n        <p>Four years later, researchers combed through participants' medical records to determine who had died. There were 4,608 deaths from all causes, as well as from specific causes such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory diseases, neurodegenerative disease, infection, and injury. Deaths from cardiovascular disease — a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">top killer of women and men</a> in the United States — were the most common cause.</p>\n        <h2>What did the researchers find?</h2>\n        <p>Participants with gratitude scores in the highest third at the study's start had a 9% lower risk of dying over the following four years than participants who scored in the bottom third. This did not change after controlling for physical health, economic circumstances, and other aspects of mental health and well-being. Gratitude seemed to help protect participants from every cause of death studied — including cardiovascular disease.</p>\n        <p>But what does this actually mean?</p>\n        <p>\"A 9% reduction in mortality risk is meaningful, but not huge,\" VanderWeele says. \"But what's remarkable about gratitude is that just about anyone can practice it. Anyone can recognize what's around them and express thanks to others for what's good in their life.\"</p>\n        <p>While the study couldn't pinpoint why gratitude is associated with longer life, VanderWeele believes several factors may contribute.</p>\n        <p>\"We know that gratitude makes people feel happier. That in itself has a small effect on mortality risk,\" he says. \"Practicing gratitude may also make someone a bit more motivated to take care of their health. Maybe they're more likely to show up for medical appointments or exercise. It may also help with relationships and social support, which we know contribute to health.\"</p>\n        <h2>What are the study's limitations and strengths?</h2>\n        <p>The study was observational. This means it can't prove that gratitude helps people live longer — only that an association exists. And the particular sample of people analyzed is both the biggest strength and limitation of the research, VanderWeele says. All were older female nurses with high socioeconomic status. The vast majority were white.</p>\n        <p>\"Does the longevity effect extend to men, to those who are younger, and to those with lower socioeconomic resources?\" VanderWeele asks. \"Those are all open questions.\"</p>\n        <p>On the plus side, he says, the study sample's large size is one of its biggest strengths. So is the extensive data gathered on potential confounding factors such as participants' physical health, social characteristics, and other aspects of psychological well-being.</p>\n        <p>\"Between the quality of the data and the size of the sample, we were able to provide reasonable evidence for this modest longevity effect,\" he says.</p>\n        <h2>Try this: Six questions to evoke gratitude</h2>\n        <p>Not feeling especially grateful today? You have the power to change that. Asking yourself certain questions can evoke gratitude, such as</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>What happened today that was good?</li>\n          <li>What am I taking for granted that I can be thankful for?</li>\n          <li>Which people in my life am I grateful for?</li>\n          <li>What is the last book I read or movie, show, or social media clip I saw that I really appreciated, and why?</li>\n          <li>What am I most looking forward to this week, month, and year, and why?</li>\n          <li>What is the kindest thing someone has said or done lately?</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Similarly, a few simple actions can infuse gratitude into your days. Try VanderWeele's family routine of regularly expressing gratitude around the dinner table. Another well-known practice — that's perhaps becoming forgotten in this digital age — is penning <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/writing-a-thank-you-note-is-more-powerful-than-you-think\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">thank-you notes</a>.</p>\n        <p>\"I do think writing a thank-you note or gratitude letter gets your mind to dwell on something positive for a longer period, to think more deeply about it, because you have to put it not just in words, but in writing,\" VanderWeele says. \"It also deepens the relationship and builds that bond.\"</p>\n        <p>One less-recognized but valuable gratitude practice is called a \"savoring exercise,\" which builds on aspects of mindfulness. All that's required is \"pausing, looking around you, and taking in and enjoying everything that's good in your current setting,\" VanderWeele says. \"It's not a big leap to go from recognizing the good to expressing gratitude for what you have.\"</p>\n      \n    "

This summer has left us all struggling to stay cool.</p>\n        <p>\"The last 13 months have been the hottest on record. We're seeing increased levels of heat-related illness, and it started earlier in the season we're used to,\" says Dr. Tess Wiskel, a climate change and human health fellow at the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment, and an emergency physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.</p>\n        <p>Don't wait until you're overheated to figure out how to cool down. Be wary of high temperature risks throughout your day and practice ways to avoid them. Here are 14 ideas to get you started.</p>\n        <h2>Cover the basics</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Become a weather expert.</strong> Use a weather app on your smartphone and pay attention to the hourly temperatures, not just daily highs and lows. Note the hottest points of the day and plan your schedule around them.</li>\n          <li><strong>Stay hydrated.</strong> One way the body cools down is by sweating. As moisture on the skin evaporates, it takes heat with it. That's called evaporative heat loss. But you must replace the fluids you lose through a combination of drinks and <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/using-food-to-stay-hydrated\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">water-rich foods</a>. Generally, the National Academy of Medicine recommends totals of <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/10925/chapter/6\" target=\"_blank\">about 11 cups (88 ounces) per day for women and 15 cups (120 ounces) per day for men</a>. If you spend a lot of time outdoors or are sweating a lot, you'll need even more fluids.</li>\n          <li><strong>Seek air-conditioned environments.</strong> As much as possible, hang out in air-conditioned indoor spaces during the hottest points of the day. If you don't have AC, go to a shopping mall, public library, movie theater, or a community cooling center.</li>\n          <li><strong>Use fans correctly.</strong> Another way the body cools down is by channeling blood and body heat to vessels near the skin's surface, where heat escapes. A fan can blow that heat away from your body and keep you cool, but not if the surrounding air is hot. \"In that case, wet your skin, even with a spray bottle or a wet wipe. The fan will promote evaporative heat loss,\" Dr. Wiskel says.</li>\n          <li><strong>Take breaks.</strong> Pace yourself when doing outdoor activity. \"Physical work produces its own heat at the same time you're being heated from outside,\" Dr. Wiskel says. \"Be active for short periods and rest in between.\"</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Pack and dress for heat</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Bring cool-downs with you.</strong> Any time you leave your home, bring plenty of water. Even better: bring a handheld fan, wet wipes, and ice packs. That way you're prepared if you get stuck outside.</li>\n          <li><strong>Wear loose clothing.</strong> Lightweight, loose-fitting garments allow air to get to your skin, promoting evaporative heat loss to keep you cool when you sweat.</li>\n          <li><strong>Try high-tech clothes.</strong> Consider wearing clothes with cooling technology (such as tops, bottoms, hats, or neck gaiters). They work in various ways. For example, a garment might be made of a special fabric that's activated with water and stays damp for a long period, continually pulling heat from your body.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Try DIY cool downs</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Make a DIY cooling garment.</strong> Dunk a kitchen towel or cotton T-shirt in cold water, wear it on your head, neck, or torso, and then rewet the fabric as it dries. Or buy higher-tech versions made with fabrics and gels designed to stay cool longer.</li>\n          <li><strong>Eat or drink something cold.</strong> A cool glass of water, ice chips, or a popsicle help fight <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/symptoms-of-dehydration-what-they-are-and-what-to-do-if-you-experience-them\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">dehydration</a> and might help lower your body's core temperature. Just don't ingest anything too quickly. Dr. Wiskel says it might cause gastrointestinal upset.</li>\n          <li><strong>Cool off with a shower or bath.</strong> Experts debate the best temperature for water to cool you down. Some maintain that cool water constricts blood vessels and sends heat back to the core, making you hot again. Others maintain that chilly water cools the blood vessels and sends cooled blood to the core. Dr. Wiskel's take: \"Immerse yourself in water that's cooler than your body temperature. The water can be tepid. Once you're out of the water, stand in front of a fan to promote evaporative heat loss.\"</li>\n          <li><strong>Submerge your forearms.</strong> If you can't take a shower or bath, try a trick used by the US Army: submerge your hands, forearms, and elbows in ice water for five minutes. This helps send cooled blood moving through blood vessels back to your core.</li>\n          <li><strong>Apply ice or cold packs.</strong> A water-free method to cool blood vessels involves placing ice packs in areas near large blood vessels such as the elbows, underarms, neck, or inside the legs near the groin area.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Know when to get help</h2>\n        <p>If you're not cooling down after trying numerous methods, Dr. Wiskel advises that you seek care. Call your doctor's office or call 911 if you're exhibiting signs of <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/extreme-heat/signs-symptoms/index.html\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">heat exhaustion</a>, such as</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>excessive sweating</li>\n          <li>headache</li>\n          <li>feeling faint or dizzy</li>\n          <li>cold, clammy skin</li>\n          <li>a fast or weak pulse</li>\n          <li>extreme fatigue</li>\n          <li>muscle cramps.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Pay extra attention to those symptoms, especially if you're vulnerable to heat and aren't able to regulate your temperature well.</p>\n        <p>\"People at high risk include older adults, babies and children, those who are pregnant, people who take medications that make them less able to sweat, people who work outdoors, and people with certain <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/extreme-heat-staying-safe-if-you-have-health-issues-202108062563\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">health conditions</a>, including cardiovascular disease,\" Dr. Wiskel says. \"And if you're not high risk, check in on people who are.\"</p>\n      \n    "

      "shortSummary": "不必要的医疗服务在美国很普遍，可能占总量的20%。过度检查、治疗和补充剂不仅耗费资源，还可能带来假阳性、副作用和不必要的焦虑。文章建议重新考虑某些癌症筛查的停止年龄、膳食补充剂的常规使用、每日阿司匹林以及针对低风险人群的心脏和前列腺癌检查。关键在于与医生沟通，权衡利弊，避免不必要的干预，因为“少即是多”能带来更好的健康结果。",

Or are you inclined to get every bit of health care you can? Maybe you feel good about getting the most out of your health insurance. Perhaps a neighborhood imaging center is advertising discounted screening tests, your employer offers health screens as a perk, or you're intrigued by ads touting supplements for a seemingly endless number of conditions.</p>\n\n<p>But keep in mind: just because you could get a particular test or treatment or take a supplement doesn't mean you should. One study suggests that as much as <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5587107/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">20% of all health care in the US is unneeded</a>. In short: when it comes to health care, more is not always better.</p>\n\n<h2>Isn't it better to be proactive about your health?</h2>\n\n<p>We're all taught that knowledge is power. So it might seem reasonable to want to know as much as possible about how your body is working. And isn't it better to take action <em>before</em> there's a problem rather than waiting for one to develop? What's the harm of erring on the side of more rather than less?</p>\n\n<p>The truth is that knowledge is <em>not</em> always power: if the information is irrelevant to your specific situation, redundant, or inaccurate, the knowledge gained through unnecessary health care can be unhelpful or even harmful. Unnecessary tests, treatments, and supplements come with risks, even when they seem harmless. And, of course, unnecessary care is not free — even if you're not paying a cent out of pocket, it drives up costs across health systems.</p>\n\n<h2>Screening tests, wellness strategies, and treatments to reconsider</h2>\n\n<p>Recommended screening tests, treatments, and supplements can be essential to good health. But when risks of harm outweigh benefits — or if proof of any benefit is lacking — think twice. Save your time, money, and effort for health care that is <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-well-do-you-worry-about-your-health-202403203027\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">focused on the most important health threats</a> and backed by evidence.</p>\n\n<h3>Cancer screening: When to stop?</h3>\n\n<p>Screening tests for some cancers are routinely recommended and can be lifesaving. But there's a reason they come with a <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/screening-tests-may-save-lives-so-when-is-it-time-to-stop-202301232879\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">recommended stop age</a>. For instance, guidelines recommend that a person at average risk of colorectal cancer with previously normal colonoscopies stop having them once they turn 75. Similar limits apply to Pap smears (age 65) and mammograms (age 75). Studies suggest that beyond those ages, there is little benefit to continuing these screens.</p>\n\n<h3>Watch out for wellness marketing</h3>\n\n<p>Dietary supplements are a multibillion-dollar industry. And a whopping <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/823603/dietary-supplement-usage-us-adults-timeline/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">70% or more of US adults take at least one</a>, such as vitamin D, fish oil, or a multivitamin. People often consider them as insurance in case vital elements are missing from their diet, or they believe supplements can prevent dementia, heart disease, or another condition.</p>\n\n<p>Yet <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-you-need-a-daily-supplement\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">little evidence supports a benefit</a> of routine supplement use for everyone. While recent studies suggest a daily multivitamin <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38244989/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">might slow cognitive decline in older adults</a>, there's no medical consensus that everyone should be taking a multivitamin. <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Fish oil (omega-3) supplements</a> haven't proven to be as healthful as simply eating servings of fatty fish and other seafood low in toxic chemicals like mercury and PCBs. And the benefits of routinely taking vitamin D supplements <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38828931/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">remain unproven</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p>It's worth emphasizing that dietary supplements clearly provide significant benefit for some people, and may be recommended by your doctor accordingly. For example, if you have a vitamin or mineral deficiency or a condition like <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/topics/macular-degeneration\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">age-related macular degeneration</a>, good evidence supports taking specific supplements.</p>\n\n<h3>Reconsider daily aspirin</h3>\n\n<p>Who should be taking low-dose aspirin regularly? Recommendations have changed in recent years, so this is worth revisiting with your health care team.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Older recommendations favored daily low-dose aspirin to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35471577/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">help prevent cardiovascular disease</a>, including first instances of heart attack and stroke.</li>\n<li>New recommendations favor low-dose aspirin for people who've already experienced a heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular disease. Adults ages 40 to 59 who are at a high risk for these conditions and low risk for bleeding also may consider it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Yet according to a recent study, <a href=\"https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M24-0427\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">nearly one-third of adults 60 and older</a> without past cardiovascular disease take aspirin, despite evidence that it provides little benefit for those at average or low risk. Aspirin can cause stomach bleeding and raise risk for a certain type of stroke.</p>\n\n<h3>Weigh in on prostate cancer screening</h3>\n\n<p>Men hear about prostate cancer often. It's common, and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men. But PSA blood tests and rectal exams to identify evidence of cancer in the prostate are no longer routinely recommended for men ages 55 to 69 by the <a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/prostate-cancer-screening#fullrecommendationstart\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">United States Preventative Services Task Force</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The reason? Studies suggest that performing these tests does not reliably reduce suffering or prolong life. Nor do possible benefits offset downsides like false positives (test results that are abnormal despite the absence of cancer). That can lead to additional testing, some of which is invasive.</p>\n\n<p>Current guidelines suggest making a shared decision with your doctor about whether to have PSA testing after reviewing the pros and cons. For men over age 70, no screening is recommended. Despite this, millions of men have PSA tests and rectal examinations routinely.</p>\n\n<h3>Not everyone needs heart tests</h3>\n\n<p>There are now more ways than ever to evaluate the health of your heart. But none are routinely recommended if you're at low risk and have no signs or symptoms of cardiovascular disease. That's right: in the absence of symptoms or a high risk of cardiovascular disease, it's generally safe to skip <a href=\"https://www.aafp.org/family-physician/patient-care/clinical-recommendations/all-clinical-recommendations/cw-ekg.html\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">EKGs, stress tests, and other cardiac tests</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet many people have these tests as part of their routine care. Why is this a problem? Having these tests without a compelling reason comes with risks, especially false positive results that can lead to invasive testing and unneeded treatment.</p>\n\n<h2>Four more reasons to avoid unnecessary care</h2>\n\n<p>Besides the concerns mentioned already, there are other reasons to avoid unnecessary care, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The discomfort or complications of testing.</strong> If you're needle-phobic, getting a blood test is a big deal. And while complications of noninvasive testing are rare (such as a skin infection from a blood test), they can occur.</li>\n<li><strong>The anxiety</strong> associated with waiting to find out test results</li>\n<li><strong>False reassurance</strong> that comes with false negatives (results that are normal or nearly so, suggesting no disease when disease is actually present)</li>\n<li><strong>All treatments have side effects.</strong> Even minor reactions — like occasional nausea or constipation — seem unacceptable if there's no reason to expect benefit from treatment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The bottom line</h2>\n\n<p>You may believe your doctor wants you to continue with your current schedule of tests and treatments, while they might think this is <em>your</em> preference! It's worth discussing if you haven't already, especially if you suspect you may be taking pills or getting tests you don't truly need.</p>\n\n<p>If your doctor says you can safely skip certain tests, treatments, and supplements, it doesn't mean that he or she is neglecting your health or that you don't deserve great health care! It's likely that the balance of risks and benefits simply doesn't support doing these things.</p>\n\n<p>Less unnecessary care could free up resources for those who need it most. And it could save you time, money, and unnecessary risks or side effects, thus improving your health. It's a good example of how less can truly be more.</p>\n    "

Swimming lessons can't prevent all of those deaths, but they can prevent a lot of them. A child doesn't need to be able to swim butterfly or do flip turns, but the ability to get back to the surface, float, tread water, and swim to where they can stand or grab onto something can save a life.</p>\n        <h2>10 things parents should know about swimming lessons</h2>\n        <p>As you think about swimming lessons, it's important to know:</p>\n        <p><strong>1. Children don't really have the cognitive skills to learn to swim until they are around 4 years old.</strong> They need to be able to listen, follow directions, and retain what they've learned, and that's usually around 4 years old, with some kids being ready a little earlier.</p>\n        <p><strong>2. That said, swim lessons between 1 and 4 years old can be useful.</strong> Not only are some kids simply ready earlier, younger children can learn some skills that can be useful if they fall into the water, like getting back to the side of a pool.</p>\n        <p><strong>3. The pool or beach where children learn must be safe.</strong> This sounds obvious, but safety isn't something you can assume; you need to check it out for yourself. The area should be clean and well maintained. There should be lifeguards that aren't involved in teaching (since teachers can't be looking at everyone at all times). There should be something that marks off areas of deeper water, and something to prevent children from getting into those deeper areas. There should be lifesaving and first aid equipment handy, and posted safety rules.</p>\n        <p><strong>4. The teachers should be trained.</strong> Again, this sounds obvious — but it's not always the case. Parents should ask about how teachers are trained and evaluated, and whether it's under the guidelines of an agency such as the Red Cross or the YMCA.</p>\n        <p><strong>5. The ratio of kids to teachers should be appropriate.</strong> Preferably, it should be as low as possible, especially for young children and new swimmers. In those cases, the teacher should be able to have all children within arm's reach and be able to watch the whole group. As children gain skills the group can get a bit bigger, but there should never be more than the teacher can safely supervise.</p>\n        <p><strong>6. There should be a curriculum and a progression — and children should be placed based on their ability.</strong> In general, swim lessons progress from getting used to the water all the way to becoming proficient at different strokes. There should be a clear way that children are assessed, and a clear plan for moving them ahead in their skills.</p>\n        <p><strong>7. Parents should be able to watch for at least some portion.</strong> You should be able to see for yourself what is going on in the class. It's not always useful or helpful for parents to be right there the whole time, as it can be distracting for children, but you should be able to watch at least the beginning and end of a lesson. Many pools have an observation window or deck.</p>\n        <p><strong>8. Flotation devices should be used thoughtfully.</strong> There is a lot of debate about the use of \"bubbles\" or other flotation devices to help children learn to swim. They can be very helpful with keeping children safe at the beginning, and helping them learn proper positioning and stroke mechanics instead of swimming frantically to stay afloat, but if they are used, the lessons should be designed to gradually decrease any reliance on them.</p>\n        <p><strong>9. Being scared of the water isn't a reason not to take, or to quit, swimming lessons.</strong> It's common and normal to be afraid of the water, and some children are more afraid than others. While you don't want to force a child to do something they are terrified of doing, giving up isn't a good idea either. Start more gradually, with lots of positive reinforcement. The swim teacher should be willing to help.</p>\n        <p><strong>10. Just because a child can swim doesn't mean he can't drown.</strong> Children can get tired, hurt, trapped, snagged, or disoriented. Even strong swimmers can get into trouble. While swimming lessons help save lives, children should always, <em>always</em> be supervised around water, and should wear life jackets for boating and other water sports.</p>\n        <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has helpful information on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/homehttps://www.cdc.gov/drowning/prevention/index.html?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwm_SzBhAsEiwAXE2Cv2mJaVfwy7n7yhJB_4ZN4QrWrta_6EGBNNlcQrNqQ8w3yvVIUzS7aRoCrw0QAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">preventing drowning</a>.

Perhaps we can all benefit from creating individual resilience plans to help handle the big and small issues that erode our sense of well-being. But what is resilience and how do you cultivate it?</p>\n        <h2>What is resilience?</h2>\n        <p>Resilience is a psychological response that helps you adapt to life's difficulties and seek a path forward through challenges.</p>\n        <p>\"It's a flexible mindset that helps you adapt, think critically, and stay focused on your values and what matters most,\" says Luana Marques, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.</p>\n        <p>While everyone has the ability to be resilient, your capacity for resilience can take a beating over time from chronic stress, perhaps from financial instability or staying in a job you dislike. The longer you're in that situation, the harder it becomes to cope with it.</p>\n        <p>Fortunately, it's possible to cultivate resilience. To do so, it helps to exercise resiliency skills as often as possible, even for minor stressors. Marques recommends the following strategies.</p>\n        <h2>Shift your thoughts</h2>\n        <p>In stressful situations, try to balance out your thoughts by adopting a broader perspective. \"This will help you stop using the emotional part of your brain and start using the thinking part of your brain. For example, if you're asking for a raise and your brain says you won't get it, think about the things you've done in your job that are worthy of a raise. You'll slow down the emotional response and shift your mindset from anxious to action,\" Marques says.</p>\n        <h2>Approach what you want</h2>\n        <p>\"When you're anxious, stressed, or <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/pouring-from-an-empty-cup-three-ways-to-refill-emotionally-202301262882\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">burned out</a>, you tend to avoid things that make you uncomfortable. That can make you feel stuck,\" Marques says. \"What you need to do is get out of your comfort zone and take a step toward the thing you want, in spite of fear.\"</p>\n        <p>For example: If you're afraid of giving a presentation, create a PowerPoint and practice it with colleagues. If you're having conflict at home, don't walk away from your partner — schedule time to talk about what's making you upset.</p>\n        <h2>Align actions with your values</h2>\n        <p>\"Stress happens when your actions are not aligned with your values — the things that matter most to you or bring you joy. For example, you might feel stressed if you care most about your family but can't be there for dinner, or care most about your health but drink a lot,\" Marques says.</p>\n        <p>She suggests that you identify your top three values and make sure your daily actions align with them. If being with family is one of the three, make your time with them a priority — perhaps find a way to join them for a daily meal. If you get joy from a clean house, make daily tidying a priority.</p>\n        <h2>Tips for success</h2>\n        <p>Practice the shift, approach, and align strategies throughout the week. \"One trick I use is looking at my calendar on Sunday and checking if my actions for the week are aligned with my values. If they aren't, I try to change things around,\" Marques says.</p>\n        <p>It's also important to live as healthy a lifestyle as possible, which will help keep your brain functioning at its best.</p>\n        <p>Healthy lifestyle habits include:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>getting seven to nine hours of sleep per night</li>\n          <li>following a healthy diet, such as a <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/a-practical-guide-to-the-mediterranean-diet-2019032116194\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Mediterranean-style diet</a></li>\n          <li>aiming for at least 150 minutes of <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/index.html\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">moderate-intensity activities</a> (such as brisk walking) each week — and adding on strength training at least twice a week</li>\n          <li>if you drink alcohol, limiting yourself to no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men</li>\n          <li>not smoking</li>\n          <li>staying socially connected, whether in person, by phone or video calls, social media, or even text messages.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Need resilience training?</h2>\n        <p>Even the best athletes have coaches, and you might benefit from resilience training.</p>\n        <p>Consider taking an online course, such as <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/learn/mental-health/harvard-university-building-personal-resilience-managing-anxiety-and-mental-health?utm_medium=partner-marketing&amp;utm_source=referral&amp;utm_campaign=harvard&amp;utm_content=HO-Resilience-course\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a> developed by Luana Marques. Or maybe turn to a therapist <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/virtual-mental-health-care-visits-making-them-work-for-you-000305133040\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">online</a> or in person for help. Look for someone who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy, which guides you to redirect negative thoughts to positive or productive ones.</p>\n        <p>Just don't put off building resilience. Practicing as you face day-to-day stresses will help you learn skills to help navigate when dark clouds roll in and seas get rough.</p>\n    "

The two biggest dietary Fs — fiber and fermented foods — are top priorities to help maintain healthy digestion, and they potentially offer much more. How can you fit these nutrients into meals? Can this help your overall health as well as gut health?</p>\n        <h2>Fiber, fermented foods, and the gut microbiome</h2>\n        <p>The gut microbiome is a composed of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms living in the colon (large intestine). What you eat, the air you breathe, where you live, and many other factors affect the makeup of the gut microbiome. Some experts think of it as a <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acschemneuro.3c00127\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">hidden organ</a> because it has a role in many important functions of the body — for example, helping the immune system function optimally, reducing chronic <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/an-action-plan-to-fight-unhealthy-inflammation-202205052739\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">inflammation</a>, keeping intestinal cells healthy, and providing some essential micronutrients that may not be included in a regular diet.</p>\n        <p>Your gut communicates with your brain through pathways in the gut-brain axis. Changes in the gut microbiome have been linked with mood and mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety. However, it's not yet clear that these changes directly cause these types of problems.</p>\n        <p>We do know that a healthy diet low in processed foods is key to a healthy gut microbiome. And increasing evidence suggests that fiber and fermented foods can play important parts here.</p>\n        <h2>Fiber 101</h2>\n        <p>Fiber's main job is to make digestion smoother by softening and adding bulk to stool, making it pass quickly through the intestines.</p>\n        <p>But fiber has other benefits for your microbiome and overall health. A high-fiber diet helps keep body weight under control and lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31809-9/fulltext\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Research</a> has found that eating enough fiber reduces the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers.</p>\n        <h3>What to know about fiber</h3>\n        <p>There are two types of fiber: insoluble (which helps you feel full and encourages regular bowel movements) and soluble (which helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar). However, recent research suggests people should focus on the total amount of fiber in their diet, rather than type of fiber.</p>\n        <p>If you're trying to add more foods with fiber to your diet, make sure you ease into new fiber-rich habits and drink plenty of water. Your digestive system must adapt slowly to avoid gas, bloating, diarrhea, and stomach cramps caused by eating too much too soon. Your body will gradually adjust to increasing fiber after a week or so.</p>\n        <h3>How much fiber do you need?</h3>\n        <p>The fiber formula is 14 grams for every 1,000 calories consumed. Your specific calorie intake can vary depending on your activity levels.</p>\n        <p>\"But instead of tracking daily fiber, focus on adding more servings of fiber-rich foods to your diet,\" says Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.</p>\n        <h3>Which foods are high in fiber?</h3>\n        <p>Fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains are all high in fiber. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans has a comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-0\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">list of fiber-rich foods</a> and their calorie counts.</p>\n        <p>What about over-the-counter fiber supplements that come in capsules, powders that you mix with water, and chewable tablets? \"If you have trouble eating enough fiber-rich foods, then these occasionally can be used, and there is no evidence they are harmful,\" says Rimm. \"But they should not serve as your primary source of dietary fiber.\"</p>\n        <h2>Fermented foods 101</h2>\n        <p>Fermented foods contain both prebiotics — ingredients that create healthy changes in the microbiome — and beneficial live bacteria called probiotics. Both <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/are-you-getting-essential-nutrients-from-your-diet\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">prebiotics and probiotics</a> help maintain a healthy gut microbiome.</p>\n        <h3>What to know about fermented foods</h3>\n        <p>Besides helping with digestion and absorbing vital nutrients from food, a healthy gut supports your immune system to help fight infections and protect against inflammation. Some <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37156006/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> suggests that certain probiotics help relieve symptoms of gut-related conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, though not all experts agree with this.</p>\n        <p>Many <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234703/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">foods that are fermented</a> undergo lacto-fermentation, in which natural bacteria feed on the sugar and starch in the food, creating lactic acid. Not only does this process remove simple sugars, it creates various species of good bacteria, such as <em>Lactobacillus</em> or <em>Bifidobacterium</em>. (Keep in mind that some foods undergo steps that remove probiotics and other healthful microbes, as with beer or wine, or make them inactive, like baking and canning.)</p>\n        <p>The exact amounts and specific strains of bacteria in fermented foods vary depending on how they are made. In addition to probiotics, fermented foods may contain other valuable nutrients like enzymes, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids.</p>\n        <h3>How often should you eat fermented foods?</h3>\n        <p>There is no recommended daily allowance for prebiotics or probiotics, so it is impossible to know precisely which fermented foods or quantities are best. The general guideline is to add more to your daily diet.</p>\n        <h3>Which fermented foods should you choose?</h3>\n        <p>Fermented foods have a range of tastes and textures because of the particular bacteria they produce during fermentation or that are added to foods. Yogurt is one of the most popular fermented foods (look for the words \"live and active cultures\" on the label). Still, <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/want-probiotics-but-dislike-yogurt-try-these-foods-202107142918\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">many options are available</a> if you are not a yogurt fan or want to expand your fermented choices. Kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, and pickles are a few examples.</p>\n        <p>As with fiber, probiotics are also marketed as over-the-counter supplements. However, like all dietary supplements, they do not require FDA approval, so there is no guarantee that the types of bacteria listed on a label can provide the promised benefits — or are even in the bottle. \"Therefore, it is best to get your probiotics from fermented foods,\" says Rimm.</p>\n        <p>\n          <em>To learn more about the value of fiber, fermented foods, and a healthy gut microbiome, listen to this episode of the <a href=\"https://www.foodweneedtotalk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Food, We Need to Talk</a> podcast, \"Understanding the Microbiome.\"</em>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://play.prx.org/e?uf=https%3A%2F%2Ffeed.foodweneedtotalk.com&amp;ge=prx_918_8c3561ad-f2a5-43da-86bb-e23d7fc5f02b\" width=\"650\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\"></iframe>\n        </p>\n    "

      "summary": "# 如果冬天让你慢了下来，那就增加活动量\n\n冬季的寒冷常常让人减少活动，但这不利于身心健康。无论你正处于严冬，还是已感受到春天的气息，今天都是开始锻炼的好时机。\n\n## 运动的好处\n\n美国疾病控制与预防中心（CDC）建议成年人每周至少进行两次肌肉强化训练，并累计至少150分钟的有氧运动。然而，美国只有不到18%的成年人达到了这些建议。增加活动量能带来多重益处：\n\n*   **改善情绪**：体育活动有助于缓解抑郁和焦虑。\n*   **降低健康风险**：充分的活动（无论时间长短）能降低患心脏病、中风、糖尿病、癌症、大脑萎缩、肌肉流失、体重增加、不良姿势、平衡感差、背痛甚至过早死亡的风险。\n\n## 克服运动障碍\n\n即使了解运动的好处，各种障碍也可能让我们久坐不动。以下是一些克服常见障碍的方法：\n\n### 如果外面很冷\n\n*   **安全条件**：当气温高于0°C（32°F）且地面干燥时，通常可以安全地进行户外锻炼。\n*   **穿着装备**：无需花哨，一件保暖外套、帽子、手套、厚袜子和防滑鞋是很好的开始。吸湿排汗的运动服装分层穿搭也有帮助。\n*   **活动建议**：可以进行快走或徒步旅行，参加定向越野活动，或使用战绳（可绑在树上）进行锻炼。\n\n### 如果有行动不便问题\n\n*   **修改锻炼方式**：大多数锻炼都可以进行调整。\n*   **水中锻炼**：在泳池中进行有氧运动或举重可能更容易，水的浮力有助于移动，且不易摔倒。\n*   **居家坐姿锻炼**：尝试坐姿瑜伽、太极、普拉提或力量训练。YouTube上有大量免费坐姿锻炼视频，建议选择可靠来源（如Silver Sneakers、物理治疗师、认证私人教练或认证运动指导员）制作的视频。\n*   **社区适应性运动**：参加社区的适应性运动项目，如适应性篮球。\n\n### 如果不喜欢正式锻炼\n\n*   **融入日常**：跳过结构化的锻炼，在日常生活中增加活动量。\n*   **高强度家务/园艺**：进行擦洗浴缸或吸尘等高强度家务，或做园艺工作。\n*   **增加步行**：爬楼梯，慢跑到邮箱，从停车场慢跑到超市等，任何能让心肺工作的活动都可以。\n*   **追踪活动**：使用智能手机（多数设备内置健身应用）或可穿戴健身追踪器记录活动时间。\n\n### 如果只能在室内活动\n\n*   **免费选择**：进行自重训练（如平板支撑、深蹲），观看免费在线锻炼视频，练习瑜伽或太极，打开音乐跳舞，拉伸，或进行阻力带训练。\n*   **预算选择**：购买跑步机，参加在线健身课程，或在线与私人教练合作。美国运动委员会（American Council on Exercise）网站上有工具可以查找您所在地区的认证教练。\n\n## 找到时间锻炼\n\n好消息是，任何量的体育活动都对健康有益。\n\n*   **短时高效**：一项2022年的研究发现，每周进行15到20分钟的剧烈运动（每天不到3分钟）与心脏病、癌症和过早死亡风险降低相关。\n*   **专家观点**：哈佛大学附属麻省总医院心血管表现项目创始人、哈佛医学院医学副教授Aaron Baggish博士指出，身体的代谢机制可以通过短时间的运动来激活，从而带来健康益处。\n*   **更多益处**：Baggish博士表示，运动越多，获得的益处也越多，例如改善情绪、平衡感，以及降低糖尿病、高血压、高胆固醇和认知能力下降的风险。\n\n## 下一步行动\n\n对大多数人来说，增加活动量是可行的。\n\n*   **咨询医生**：如果您有心脏病、平衡感差、肌肉无力或容易气喘，请咨询医生或寻求物理治疗师的评估。\n*   **循序渐进**：无论选择何种活动，都要循序渐进。长时间不活动后，肌肉更容易受伤。\n*   **正常反应**：哈佛大学附属斯波尔丁康复医院运动医学专家Sarah Eby博士表示，如果肌肉被要求做更多运动，最初可能会感到酸痛，这是正常的。\n*   **设定目标**：确保从低强度开始，并随着时间推移缓慢增加持续时间和强度。选择你喜欢的活动，设定小而可衡量、可实现的目标，即使只是本周每天步行五分钟。\n\n记住：目标只是比以前多运动。你动得越多，身体就越好。\n\n![一名男子手持电视遥控器，穿着袜子和牛仔裤的脚和腿搭在沙发上，背景电视屏幕显示着美丽的蓝天、树木和蓬松的云朵](http://content.health.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/96cf6052-83ba-4116-88bf-767390a5a2e2.jpg)",

But a lack of activity isn't good for body or mind during any season. And whether you're deep in the grip of winter or fortunate to be basking in signs of spring, today is a good day to start exercising. If you're not sure where to start — or why you should — we've shared tips and answers below.</p>\n        <h2>Moving more: What's in it for all of us?</h2>\n        <p>We're all supposed to strengthen our muscles at least twice a week and get a total at least 150 minutes of weekly aerobic activity (the kind that gets your heart and lungs working). But fewer than 18% of U.S. adults meet those weekly recommendations, according to the CDC.</p>\n        <p>How can choosing to become more active help? A brighter mood is one benefit: <a href=\"https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/18/1203\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">physical activity helps ease depression and anxiety</a>, for example. And being sufficiently active — whether in short or longer chunks of time — also lowers your risk for health problems like</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>heart disease</li>\n          <li>stroke</li>\n          <li>diabetes</li>\n          <li>cancer</li>\n          <li>brain shrinkage</li>\n          <li>muscle loss</li>\n          <li>weight gain</li>\n          <li>poor posture</li>\n          <li>poor balance</li>\n          <li>back pain</li>\n          <li>and even premature death.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>What are your exercise obstacles?</h2>\n        <p>Even when we understand these benefits, a range of obstacles may keep us on the couch.</p>\n        <p>Don't like the cold? Have trouble standing, walking, or moving around easily? Just don't like exercise? Don't let obstacles like these stop you anymore. Try some workarounds.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>If it's cold outside:</strong> It's generally safe to exercise when the mercury is above 32° F and the ground is dry. The right gear for cold doesn't need to be fancy. A warm jacket, a hat, gloves, heavy socks, and nonslip shoes are a great start. Layers of athletic clothing that wick away moisture while keeping you warm can help, too. Consider going for a brisk walk or <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/winter-hiking-magical-or-miserable-202301102873\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">hike</a>, taking part in an <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/orienteering-great-exercise-and-better-thinking-skills-202307102953\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">orienteering event</a>, or working out with battle ropes ($25 and up) that you attach to a tree.</li>\n          <li><strong>If you have mobility issues:</strong> Most workouts can be modified. For example, it might be easier to do an aerobics or weights <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/advantages-of-water-based-exercise\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">workout in a pool</a>, where buoyancy makes it easier to move and there's little fear of falling. Or try a seated workout at home, such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCi3VQb4Xk0\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">chair yoga</a>, <a href=\"https://news.va.gov/109004/live-whole-health-138-tai-chi-basic-moves/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">tai chi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U73T-XiIm9Y\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Pilates</a>, or strength training. You'll find an endless array of free seated workout videos on YouTube, but look for those created by a reliable source such as <a href=\"https://tools.silversneakers.com/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">Silver Sneakers</a>, or a physical therapist, certified personal trainer, or certified exercise instructor. Another option is an <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/taking-up-adaptive-sports-202209122813\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">adaptive sports program</a> in your community, such as adaptive basketball.</li>\n          <li><strong>If you can't stand formal exercise:</strong> Skip a structured workout and just be more active throughout the day. Do some vigorous housework (like scrubbing a bathtub or vacuuming) or yard work, climb stairs, jog to the mailbox, jog from the parking lot to the grocery store, or do any activity that gets your heart and lungs working. Track your activity minutes with a smartphone (most devices come with built-in fitness apps) or wearable fitness tracker ($20 and up).</li>\n          <li><strong>If you're stuck indoors:</strong> The pandemic showed us there are lots of indoor exercise options. If you're looking for free options, do a <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/get-a-lift-from-body-weight-workouts\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">body-weight workout</a>, with exercises like planks and squats; follow a free exercise video online; practice yoga or tai chi; turn on music and dance; stretch; or do a <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/resistance-bands-3-great-ways-to-build-upper-body-strength-202105182458\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">resistance band workout</a>. Or if it's in the budget, get a treadmill, take an online exercise class, or work online with a personal trainer. The <a href=\"http://www.acefitness.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">American Council on Exercise</a> has a tool on its website to locate certified trainers in your area.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Is it hard to find time to exercise?</h2>\n        <p>The good news is that any amount of physical activity is great for health. For example, a 2022 study found that racking up <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/43/46/4801/6771381?login=false\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\" target=\"_blank\">15 to 20 minutes of weekly vigorous exercise</a> (less than three minutes per day) was tied to lower risks of heart disease, cancer, and early death.</p>\n        <p>\"We don't quite understand how it works, but we do know the body's metabolic machinery that imparts health benefits can be turned on by short bouts of movement spread across days or weeks,\" says Dr. Aaron Baggish, founder of Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital's Cardiovascular Performance Program and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.</p>\n        <p>And the more you exercise, Dr. Baggish says, the more benefits you accrue, such as better mood, better balance, and reduced risks of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and cognitive decline.</p>\n        <h2>What's the next step to take?</h2>\n        <p>For most people, increasing activity is doable. If you have a heart condition, poor balance, muscle weakness, or you're easily winded, talk to your doctor or get an evaluation from a physical therapist.</p>\n        <p>And no matter which activity you select, ease into it. When you've been inactive for a while, your muscles are vulnerable to injury if you do too much too soon.</p>\n        <p>\"Your muscles may be sore initially if they are being asked to do more,\" says Dr. Sarah Eby, a sports medicine specialist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. \"That's normal. Just be sure to start low, and slowly increase your duration and intensity over time. Pick activities you enjoy and set small, measurable, and attainable goals, even if it's as simple as walking five minutes every day this week.\"</p>\n        <p>Remember: the aim is simply exercising more than you have been. And the more you move, the better.</p>\n      \n    "

      "summary": "## 器官捐赠：一份超越巧克力的生命礼物\n\n情人节不仅是赠送鲜花和巧克力的日子，它也被称为“国家捐赠者日”，旨在鼓励人们进行器官、组织和血液捐赠。这是一种能够真正改变生命的礼物，其价值远超任何物质财富。然而，尽管约90%的美国人支持器官捐赠，但只有40%的人实际注册成为捐赠者。\n\n### 捐赠的巨大影响\n\n对于那些面临肾衰竭、肝衰竭、癌症需要骨髓移植或因角膜疾病失明的人来说，器官或组织捐赠可能是他们唯一的希望。这种捐赠能让受赠者获得更长的生命、更好的生活质量，或两者兼得。目前，美国有超过103,000名儿童、妇女和男性正在等待器官移植，每年约有6,200人在等待中去世，这凸显了捐赠者数量的严重不足。\n\n### 可捐赠的器官、组织与细胞\n\n捐赠的方式多种多样，一个捐赠者可以帮助超过80人。捐赠可分为逝世后捐赠和活体捐赠：\n\n*   **逝世后捐赠：**\n    *   骨骼、软骨和肌腱\n    *   角膜\n    *   面部和手部（不常见，但已加入列表）\n    *   肾脏、肝脏、肺、心脏和心脏瓣膜\n    *   胃和肠\n    *   神经、胰腺\n    *   皮肤、动脉和静脉\n\n*   **活体捐赠：**\n    *   **分娩组织：** 如胎盘、脐带和羊水，可用于愈合皮肤伤口或溃疡，预防感染。\n    *   **血细胞、血清或骨髓：**\n    *   **部分器官：** 如肾脏、部分肺、肠、肝脏或胰腺。\n\n### 关于逝世后捐赠的常见误解\n\n许多关于逝世后器官捐赠的误解限制了人们的注册意愿，但这些都是不真实的：\n\n*   **医生会因为你是器官捐赠者而不尽力抢救你的生命。** 事实是，合法的医疗专业人员始终将患者的利益放在首位，器官捐赠的决定绝不会影响医疗护理。\n*   **医生会在死亡前摘取器官。** 这是错误的。\n*   **宗教禁止器官捐赠。** 大多数主要宗教都允许并支持器官捐赠。\n*   **捐赠器官后不能举行开棺葬礼。** 逝世后器官捐赠不会在遗体上留下外在痕迹，因此开棺葬礼仍然是可行的。\n\n### 活体捐赠：风险与程序\n\n活体捐赠的风险因捐赠类型而异：\n\n*   **血液、血小板或血浆：** 风险极低或没有风险。\n*   **骨髓：** 需要小型外科手术，存在麻醉反应风险。术后常见背部或髋部疼痛，但可通过止痛药控制，身体会迅速补充骨髓，通常无长期问题。\n*   **干细胞：** 可通过类似献血的过程捐赠（约7-8小时）。捐赠前需服用药物（Filgrastim）促进干细胞生成，可能引起流感样症状、骨痛和疲劳，但通常在手术后很快消退。\n*   **肾脏、肺或肝脏：** 捐赠部分器官的手术伴随并发症、麻醉反应和较长的恢复时间。尽管如此，绝大多数活体器官捐赠都未出现并发症，捐赠者通常对体验感到非常积极。\n\n### 谁可以捐赠？\n\n几乎任何人都可以捐赠血细胞（包括干细胞）、骨髓、组织或器官。例外情况包括患有活动性癌症、广泛感染或器官不健康的人。年龄本身不是器官捐赠的限制因素；2023年，五分之二的器官捐赠者年龄超过50岁，甚至有90多岁的捐赠者。然而，骨髓移植在捐赠者年龄较大时成功率可能降低，因此通常避免55或60岁以上的人进行骨髓捐赠。\n\n### 寻找匹配：免疫兼容性\n\n许多移植的最佳结果取决于捐赠者和受赠者之间的免疫兼容性，这主要通过HLA分型（通过血液测试或颊拭子）来确定。亲属之间通常有更好的HLA匹配，但陌生人也可能匹配。某些HLA类型捐赠者较少，使得寻找匹配更具挑战性。现有健康差异（如非裔美国人及有色人种社区肾病发病率较高）因这些社区捐赠者数量较少而加剧，部分原因是对医疗系统缺乏信任。\n\n### 总结与呼吁\n\n无论是在生前还是逝世后成为捐赠者，你都能产生巨大的影响。在美国，逝世后捐赠需要“选择加入”（opt-in）模式，而许多其他国家采用的“选择退出”（opt-out）模式已被证明能显著提高器官捐赠率。文章希望美国乃至全球的器官捐赠率能随着时间推移而增加。除了情人节的巧克力，今年你或许可以做出更大的贡献，成为一名捐赠者。\n\n![photo illustration of a heart shape in dark red with the words organ donors save lives on it in white](http://content.health.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/77cb4ef9-cfe9-4673-a289-e68cb1017153.jpg)",

But what if the gifts we give then or throughout the year could be truly life-changing? A gift that could save a life or free someone from dialysis?</p>\n        <p>You can do this. For people in need of an organ, tissue, or blood donation, a donor can give them a gift that exceeds the value of anything that you can buy. Fittingly, Valentine's Day is also known as <a href=\"https://www.donatelife.net/celebrations/national-donor-day/\" target=\"_blank\">National Donor Day</a>, a time for blood drives and sign-ups for organ and tissue donation. Have you ever wondered what can be donated? Had reservations about donating after death or concerns about risks for live donors? Read on.</p>\n        <h2>The enormous impact of organ, tissue, or cell donation</h2>\n        <p>Imagine you have kidney failure requiring dialysis 12 or more hours each week just to stay alive. Even with this, you know you're still likely to die a premature death. Or, if your liver is failing, you may experience severe nausea, itching, and confusion; death may only be a matter of weeks or months away. For those with cancer in need of a bone marrow transplant, or someone who's lost their vision due to corneal disease, finding a donor may be their only good option.</p>\n        <p>Organ or tissue donation can turn these problems around, giving recipients a chance at a long life, a better quality of life, or both. And yet, the number of people who need organ donation far exceeds compatible donors. While national surveys have found about <a href=\"https://www.organdonor.gov/professionals/grants-research/research-reports\" target=\"_blank\">90% of Americans support organ donation</a>, only <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/45534-americans-views-registering-organ-donors-poll?redirect_from=%2Ftopics%2Fsociety%2Farticles-reports%2F2023%2F04%2F07%2Famericans-views-registering-organ-donors-poll\" target=\"_blank\">40% have signed up</a>. More than <a href=\"https://www.organdonor.gov/statistics-stories/statistics.html\" target=\"_blank\">103,000 women, men, and children are awaiting an organ transplant</a> in the US. About 6,200 die each year, still waiting.</p>\n        <h2>What can you donate?</h2>\n        <p>The list of ways to help has grown dramatically. Some organs, tissues, or cells can be donated while you're alive; other donations are only possible after death. A single donor can help more than 80 people!</p>\n        <p>After death, people can donate:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>bone, cartilage, and tendons</li>\n          <li>corneas</li>\n          <li>face and hands (though uncommon, they are among the newest additions to this list)</li>\n          <li>kidneys</li>\n          <li>liver</li>\n          <li>lungs</li>\n          <li>heart and heart valves</li>\n          <li>stomach and intestine</li>\n          <li>nerves</li>\n          <li>pancreas</li>\n          <li>skin</li>\n          <li>arteries and veins.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Live donations may include:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>birth tissue, such as the placenta, umbilical cord, and amniotic fluid, which can be used to help heal skin wounds or ulcers and prevent infection</li>\n          <li>blood cells, serum, or bone marrow</li>\n          <li>a kidney</li>\n          <li>part of a lung</li>\n          <li>part of the intestine, liver, or pancreas.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>To learn more about different types of organ donations, visit <a href=\"https://www.donatelife.net/types-of-donation/\" target=\"_blank\">Donate Life America</a>.</p>\n        <h2>Becoming a donor after death: Questions and misconceptions</h2>\n        <p>Common misconceptions about becoming an organ donor limit the number of people who are willing to sign up. For example, many people mistakenly believe that</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>doctors won't work as hard to save your life if you're known to be an organ donor — or worse, doctors will harvest organs before death</li>\n          <li>their religion forbids organ donation</li>\n          <li>you cannot have an open-casket funeral if you donate your organs.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>None of these is true, and none should discourage you from becoming an organ donor. Legitimate medical professionals always keep the patient's interests front and center. Care would never be jeopardized due to a person's choices around organ donation. Most major religions allow and support organ donation. If organ donation occurs after death, the clothed body will show no outward signs of organ donation, so an open-casket funeral is an option for organ donors.</p>\n        <h2>Live donors: Blood, bone marrow, and organs</h2>\n        <p>Have you ever donated blood? Congratulations, you're a live donor! The risk for live donors varies depending on the intended donation, such as:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Blood, platelets, or plasma:</strong> If you're <a href=\"https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/types-of-blood-donations.html\" target=\"_blank\">donating blood or blood products</a>, there is little or no risk involved.</li>\n          <li><strong>Bone marrow:</strong> Donating bone marrow requires a minor surgical procedure. If general anesthesia is used, there is a chance of a reaction to the anesthesia. Bone marrow is removed through needles inserted into the back of the pelvis bones on each side. Back or hip pain is common, but can be controlled with pain relievers. The body quickly replaces the bone marrow removed, so no long-term problems are expected.</li>\n          <li><strong>Stem cells:</strong> Stem cells are found in bone marrow or umbilical cord blood. They also appear in small numbers in our blood and can be donated through a process similar to blood donation. This takes about seven or eight hours. Filgrastim, a medication that increases stem cell production, is given for a number of days beforehand. It can cause side effects such as flulike symptoms, bone pain, and fatigue, but these tend to resolve soon after the procedure.</li>\n          <li><strong>Kidney, lung, or liver:</strong> Surgery to donate a kidney or a portion of a lung or liver comes with a risk of complications, reactions to anesthesia, and significant recovery time. It's no small matter to give a kidney, or part of a lung or liver.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>The vast number of live organ donations occur without complications, and donors typically feel quite positive about the experience.</p>\n        <h2>Who can donate?</h2>\n        <p>Almost anyone can donate <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-fda-relaxes-restrictions-on-blood-donation-202305192936\" target=\"_blank\">blood cells</a> –– including stem cells –– or be a <a href=\"https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/process/living-donation\" target=\"_blank\">bone marrow, tissue, or organ</a> donor. Exceptions include anyone with active cancer, widespread infection, or organs that aren't healthy.</p>\n        <p>What about age? By itself, your age does not disqualify you from organ donation. In 2023, <a href=\"https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/who-can-donate/seniors\" target=\"_blank\">two out of five people donating organs</a> were over 50. People in their 90s have donated organs upon their deaths and saved the lives of others.</p>\n        <p>However, bone marrow transplants may fail more often when the donor is older, so bone marrow donations by people over age 55 or 60 are usually avoided.</p>\n        <h2>Finding a good match: Immune compatibility</h2>\n        <p>For many transplants, the best results occur when there is immune compatibility between the donor and recipient. Compatibility is based largely on HLA typing, which analyzes genetically-determined proteins on the surface of most cells. These proteins help the immune system identify which cells qualify as foreign or self. Foreign cells trigger an immune attack; cells identified as self should not.</p>\n        <p>HLA typing can be done by a blood test or cheek swab. Close relatives tend to have the best HLA matches, but complete strangers may be a good match as well.</p>\n        <p>Fewer donors among people with certain HLA types make finding a match more challenging. Already existing health disparities, such as higher rates of kidney disease among <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/whats-behind-racial-disparities-in-kidney-disease-2021020321842\" target=\"_blank\">Black Americans</a> and <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/race-ethnicity\" target=\"_blank\">communities of color</a>, are worsened by <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/race-ethnicity\"></a><a href=\"https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/organ-donation-and-african-americans\" target=\"_blank\">lower numbers of donors</a> from these communities, an inequity partly driven by a lack of trust in the medical system.</p>\n        <h2>The bottom line</h2>\n        <p>You can make an enormous impact by becoming a donor during your life or after death. In the US, you must opt in to be a donor after death. (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31428836/\" target=\"_blank\">Research</a> suggests the opt-out approach many other countries use could significantly increase rates of organ donation in this country.)</p>\n        <p>I'm hopeful that organ donation in the US and throughout the world will increase over time. While you can still go with chocolates for Valentine's Day, maybe this year you can also go bigger and become a donor.</p>\n      \n    "

      "shortSummary": "本文探讨了男孩中日益普遍的肌肉畸形，这是一种身体畸形障碍，表现为对肌肉发达体格的过度关注。社会信息将肌肉与男子气概挂钩，导致许多男孩产生不健康的肌肉追求。家长应警惕儿子锻炼习惯、饮食、社交活动、自我衡量和穿着的异常变化。这种痴迷可能导致严重的身体（如滥用补充剂、器官损伤）和心理（如抑郁、自卑）健康风险。为促进健康身体形象，家长应全家用餐、避免评论体型、强调健康而非外形、开放沟通，并避免购买蛋白质补充剂。",

By adolescence, they're deluged with social media streams of bulked-up male bodies.</p>\n        <p>The underlying messages about power and worth prompt many boys to worry and wonder about how to measure up. Sometimes, negative thoughts and concerns even interfere with daily life, a mental health issue known body dysmorphic disorder, or body dysmorphia. The most common form of this in boys is muscle dysmorphia.</p>\n        <h2>What is muscle dysmorphia?</h2>\n        <p>Muscle dysmorphia is marked by preoccupation with a muscular and lean physique. While the more extreme behaviors that define this disorder appear only in a small percentage of boys and young men, it may color the mindset of many more.</p>\n        <p>Nearly a quarter of boys and young men engage in some type of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7867380/#:~:text=Nearly%2022%25%20of%20young%20men,associated%20with%20disordered%20eating%20behaviors.\" target=\"_blank\">muscle-building behaviors</a>. \"About 60% of young boys in the United States mention changing their diet to become more muscular,\" says Dr. Gabriela Vargas, director of the <a href=\"https://youngmenshealthsite.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Young Men's Health website</a> at Boston Children's Hospital. \"While that may not meet the diagnostic criteria of muscle dysmorphia disorder, it's impacting a lot of young men.\"</p>\n        <p>\"There's a social norm that equates muscularity with masculinity,\" Dr. Vargas adds. \"Even Halloween costumes for 4- and 5-year-old boys now have padding for six-pack abs. There's constant messaging that this is what their bodies should look like.\"</p>\n        <h2>Does body dysmorphic disorder differ in boys and girls?</h2>\n        <p>Long believed to be the domain of girls, body dysmorphia can take the form of <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/eating-disorders-spike-among-children-and-teens-what-parents-should-know-202204212731\" target=\"_blank\">eating disorders</a> such as anorexia or bulimia. Technically, muscle dysmorphia is not an eating disorder. But it is far more pervasive in males — and insidious.</p>\n        <p>\"The common notion is that body dysmorphia just affects girls and isn't a male issue,\" Dr. Vargas says. \"Because of that, these unhealthy behaviors in boys often go overlooked.\"</p>\n        <h2>What are the signs of body dysmorphia in boys?</h2>\n        <p>Parents may have a tough time discerning whether their son is merely being a teen or veering into dangerous territory. Dr. Vargas advises parents to look for these red flags:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Marked change in physical routines, such as going from working out once a day to spending hours working out every day.</li>\n          <li>Following regimented workouts or meals, including limiting the foods they're eating or concentrating heavily on high-protein options.</li>\n          <li>Disrupting normal activities, such as spending time with friends, to work out instead.</li>\n          <li>Obsessively taking photos of their muscles or abdomen to track \"improvement.\"</li>\n          <li>Weighing himself multiple times a day.</li>\n          <li>Dressing to highlight a more muscular physique, or wearing baggier clothes to hide their physique because they don't think it's good enough.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>\"Nearly everyone has been on a diet,\" Dr. Vargas says. \"The difference with this is persistence — they don't just try it for a week and then decide it's not for them. These boys are doing this for weeks to months, and they're not flexible in changing their behaviors.\"</p>\n        <h2>What are the health dangers of muscle dysmorphia in boys?</h2>\n        <p>Extreme behaviors can pose physical and mental health risks.</p>\n        <p>For example, unregulated protein powders and supplements boys turn to in hopes of quickly bulking up muscles may be adulterated with stimulants or even anabolic steroids. \"With that comes an increased risk of stroke, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, and liver injury,\" notes Dr. Vargas.</p>\n        <p>Some boys also attempt to gain muscle through a \"bulk and cut\" regimen, with periods of rapid weight gain followed by periods of extreme calorie limitation. This can affect long-term muscle and bone development and lead to irregular heartbeat and lower testosterone levels.</p>\n        <p>\"Even in a best-case scenario, eating too much protein can lead to a lot of intestinal distress, such as diarrhea, or to kidney injury, since our kidneys are not meant to filter out excessive amounts of protein,\" Dr. Vargas says.</p>\n        <p>The psychological fallout can also be dramatic. Depression and suicidal thoughts are more common in people who are malnourished, which may occur when boys drastically cut calories or neglect entire food groups. Additionally, as they try to achieve unrealistic ideals, they may constantly feel like they're not good enough.</p>\n        <h2>How can parents encourage a healthy body image in boys?</h2>\n        <p>These tips can help:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Gather for family meals</strong>. Schedules can be tricky. Yet considerable research shows physical and mental health benefits flow from sitting down together for meals, including a greater likelihood of children being an appropriate weight for their body type.</li>\n          <li><strong>Don't comment on body shape or size.</strong> \"It's a lot easier said than done, but this means your own body, your child's, or others in the community,\" says Dr. Vargas.</li>\n          <li><strong>Frame nutrition and exercise as meaningful for health.</strong> When you talk with your son about what you eat or your exercise routine, don't tie hoped-for results to body shape or size.</li>\n          <li><strong>Communicate openly.</strong> \"If your son says he wants to exercise more or increase his protein intake, ask why — for his overall health, or a specific body ideal?\"</li>\n          <li><strong>Don't buy protein supplements.</strong> It's harder for boys to obtain them when parents won't allow them in the house. \"One alternative is to talk with your son's primary care doctor or a dietitian, who can be a great resource on how to get protein through regular foods,\" Dr. Vargas says.</li>\n        </ul>\n      \n    "

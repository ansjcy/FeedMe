      "content": "Along with the low-cost MacBook, Apple could introduce a refreshed version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> next week. Most of the focus will be on the new machine, but the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is expected to get some useful internal updates.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/macbook-air-blue.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032534\" />\r<br/>\n<h2>M5 Chip</h2>\r<br/>\nThe next-generation &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; will adopt the M5 chip, which Apple already introduced in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> models that came out last year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's M5 chip uses third-generation 3-nanometer technology, and it features up to a 10-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU with 3.5x faster performance than the M4 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe M5's multithreaded CPU performance is up to 15 percent faster than the M4, and it offers 30 percent faster GPU performance. Apple added a Neural Accelerator to each GPU core to improve the speeds of GPU-based AI workloads. Unified memory bandwidth is 153GB/s, which is close to a 30 percent improvement over the M4's memory bandwidth. Unified memory architecture lets the chip use a single memory pool for running AI models on device, boosting GPU performance, and improving multithreaded performance in apps, so an upgrade there is meaningful. RAM will continue to start at 16GB, with 24GB and 32GB available as upgrade options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThird-generation ray-tracing, second-generation dynamic caching, and enhanced shader cores bring improvements to gaming and other system-intensive tasks. An updated 16-core Neural Engine is more energy efficient than before, so we could see battery life improvements.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nStorage tiers are likely to stay the same, starting at 256GB with 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB available as upgrade options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Design</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; got a design overhaul in 2022, and there are no signs that Apple is planning for an updated chassis in 2026. Apple often uses the same design for several years before updating, and design refreshes are usually tied to major new features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are rumors that the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; will get an OLED display sometime after Apple launches new &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models with OLED technology in late 2026, so we could be waiting for OLED before we get another major design update.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe're expecting Apple to release the same 13-inch and 15-inch size options in 2026. Both will feature the same aluminum unibody design and fanless thermal system, along with a Retina LCD display.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is likely to continue to offer two Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports, and the same speaker, microphone, and camera setup.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\r<br/>\n&zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; pricing is not expected to change, and it should continue to start at &#36;1,099. There is a possibility that memory upgrades will be more expensive due to DRAM shortages that have driven prices up.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Release Date</h2>\r<br/>\nApple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> teased product announcements that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/26/apple-teases-a-big-week-ahead/\">are set to start on Monday</a>, so we could see the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; as soon as next week.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/26/m5-macbook-air-latest-info/\">What&#039;s Coming in the M5 MacBook Air</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whats-coming-in-the-m5-macbook-air.2478281/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Power is delivered through a USB-C cable that can be plugged into a 30W+ power adapter or a Mac.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCharging speeds are limited to 15W, so you won't get full speed wireless charging on newer iPhones that support up to 25W wireless charging. The sleeve has one 15W charging spot for an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and a 5W charging spot for the AirPods. It is not designed to charge two iPhones at once, both because there's just one 15W charger and because of space constraints.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe title=\"Razer Laptop Sleeve 16\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZTDO9sW_zc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r<br/>\nThere is built-in padding to keep a MacBook safe from drops, and a plush lining inside protects it from scratches. The exterior is black and made from a polyester material that's designed to resist wear and tear while also protecting a laptop from rain.

Major smart home companies that produce smart locks have also signed on to support Aliro. The Alliance says that Apple, Allegion, Aqara, Google, HID, Kastle, Kwikset, Last Lock, Nordic Semiconductor, Nuki Home Solutions, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Samsung, and STMicroelectronics will be among the first to achieve Aliro 1.0 certification.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith Aliro, more smart locks should support Apple Home Key for hands-free unlocking with NFC and UWB.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Aliro 1.0 specification includes a framework for using asymmetric cryptography for secure interactions between user devices and readers, without sacrificing user privacy. It supports multiple communication methods, including NFC, Bluetooth LE, and ultra wideband (UWB).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAliro will be updated over time to meet new market and ecosystem requirements.

Current colors include blue, pink, silver, and yellow.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNo changes are expected for the rear camera, front camera, USB-C port, or compatibility with accessories like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"a-series_processor\">A-Series Processor</h2>\r<br/>\nThe low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will likely be equipped with Apple's A19 chip, which is the chip that Apple used for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>. It is built on a 3-nanometer process and it will offer speed and efficiency improvements over the A16 chip that's in the current model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A16 chip that Apple used in 2025 does not support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, but the A19 does, so that will mark a major update for Apple's affordable tablet. The 2026 model should be able to support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features that are unavailable with the 2025 model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A19 also offers hardware-accelerated ray tracing for gaming improvements. The 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; has 6GB RAM, but Apple will need to bump that up to 8GB for &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"n1_chip\">N1 Chip</h2>\r<br/>\nApple introduced its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip, called the N1, in the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models. The N1 was added to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and it's possible that Apple plans to add the chip to all future devices coming in 2026 and beyond.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe N1 chip supports Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread networking technology for smart home devices.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is limited to Wi-Fi 6, so if the 12th-generation version gets Wi-Fi 7, it will be able to connect to faster 6GHz networks for the first time. Bluetooth 6 would also be an improvement over Bluetooth 5.3. There is a chance that Apple is reserving the N1 chip for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/homepod-mini-2-chip-rumor/\">its more premium devices</a>, based on leaked internal code. If that's the case, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; won't include the N1 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"apple_modem\">Apple Modem</h2>\r<br/>\nApple has designed C1 and C1X modem chips that it has used in iPhones and iPads in 2025, and the next-generation version of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; could also get an Apple-designed modem chip for cellular models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's modem chips are more power efficient than Qualcomm chips while providing similar performance.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h2>\r<br/>\nThe 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;349 for 128GB of storage, and there are so far no indications that pricing is going to change for the 12th-generation model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"launch_date\">Launch Date</h2>\r<br/>\nApple will likely launch the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/26/apple-teases-a-big-week-ahead/\">sometime next week</a>, just ahead of the Special Experience planned for March 4.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/26/low-cost-ipad-latest-rumors/\">New Low-Cost iPad Coming Next Week: What to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-low-cost-ipad-coming-next-week-what-to-expect.2478272/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Specifically, the regulator said the feature unfairly disadvantaged both third-party app developers and advertisers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSince the release of iOS 14.5 in April 2021, Apple has required apps to ask for permission before tracking a user's activity across other apps and websites for personalized advertising. If a user selects the \"Ask App Not to Track\" option, the app is unable to access the device's advertising identifier. The feature enhances user privacy, but some advertisers have complained that it has significantly impacted revenue.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLast year, Apple warned that it may be forced to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/23/apple-app-tracking-transparency-europe/\">stop offering App Tracking Transparency in the EU</a> due to regulatory pressures in countries such as France, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/22/italy-fines-apple-over-app-tracking-transparency/\">Italy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/02/germany-app-tracking-transparency/\">Germany</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/25/apple-polish-probe-app-tracking-transparency/\">Poland</a>, and from the overarching European Commission.

Japanese users do not have access to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/\">Apple One</a> plan that includes Apple Fitness+, as Apple does not provide a Premier plan in the country.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple said back in December that Apple Fitness+ would expand to Japan in early 2026. The service also recently became available in 28 new markets, including Hong Kong, India, the Netherlands, Singapore, and Taiwan.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFitness+ workouts and meditations are digitally dubbed with a generated voice in Japanese, with more dubbed episodes added on a weekly basis. Apple also provides workouts in English or with Spanish and German dubbing. Digital dubbing requires iOS 26.1, iPadOS 26.1, and tvOS 26.1.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith the addition of Japan, users in 49 countries and regions around the world are able to access the Apple Fitness+ service.

      "content": "We're likely just weeks away from Apple's next <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> launch, with the company set to introduce the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is a follow-up to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a> that came out in February 2025, and rumors suggest that it could have some welcome improvements.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009543\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17e-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"design\">Design</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is supposedly going to look a lot like the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, featuring the same 6.1-inch display size, single-lens rear camera, and black and white color options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile the display isn't changing much, the device could have a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a> instead of a notch, which would be a marked visual difference.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"display\">Display</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to feature the same display panel as the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, which means it will be limited to a 60Hz refresh rate. Apple brought 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates to the standard <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> in 2025, but the same technology is not expected for the more affordable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n120Hz refresh rates provide video improvements and smoother scrolling when viewing webpages.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; does not have always-on display technology, and that's not likely to change with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e. To support always-on, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e would need an OLED display with 1-nit minimum brightness, which is limited to Apple's more expensive iPhones. HDR and brightness are also lacking compared to Apple's flagship lineup.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThough the display isn't changing, there have been rumors suggesting Apple could <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/iphone-17e-same-oled-panel-slimmer-bezels/\">shrink the bezel size</a> somewhat, allowing for more visible display area.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic_island\">Dynamic Island</h3>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; continues to feature the notch that Apple has eliminated in its newer flagship iPhones, but the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e might do away with it. Rumors suggest that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will have a &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; instead of a notch, giving it a more modern look.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iPhone-14-Pro-Dynamic-Island.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003664\" />\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; is a pill-shaped cutout on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display that houses the TrueDepth camera system and the front-facing camera. It takes up less display area than the notch, and it is better integrated into the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple uses software to change the size and shape of the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; to accommodate alerts, notifications, and Live Activities. The &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; can show everything from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a> turn-by-turn directions to active timers, incoming phone calls, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> activations. It also displays privacy indicators for the microphone or camera, alerts when accessories connect, and indicators for the flashlight, screen recording, incoming AirDrop files, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; is much more interactive and useful than the notch, because there is an option to tap into the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; to access different app features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOne rumor suggests the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/iphone-17e-same-oled-panel-slimmer-bezels/\">continue to use a notch</a>, so the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; upgrade isn't a guarantee.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"a19_chip\">A19 Chip</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to use Apple's A19 chip, which was first introduced in the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;. The A19 chip is built using Apple's upgraded N3P 3-nanometer process, offering a 5 to 10 percent performance improvement over the A18 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple could be planning to use a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/06/iphone-17e-dynamic-island-a19-chip/\">downclocked version</a> of the A19 chip in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e, and if that's the case, its performance won't quite match the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;'s performance.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A18 chip that Apple used in the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; had a 4-core GPU instead of a 5-core GPU like the version from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, so the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e could get a similar GPU downgrade.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAside from the improved CPU and GPU, the A19 has an updated display engine, image signal processor, and Neural Engine for improved AI performance. Every GPU core features a Neural Accelerator to boost the performance of local AI models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe are expecting the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e to continue to include 8GB RAM like the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;. Apple's other models have 12GB.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"magsafe_compatibility\">MagSafe Compatibility</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; does not have a magnetic ring for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> charging, but the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e could feature &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; compatibility. Rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/iphone-17e-rumored-to-fix-iphone-16e-limitation/\">magnetic wireless charging</a>, which would be a major upgrade over the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's iPhones have used &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; since the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12, so there are a wide array of &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; cases and accessories. The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is not compatible with these accessories, which is a major limitation.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSince it doesn't have &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is limited to 7.5W wireless charging speeds. &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; would upgrade that to at least 15W. The current &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models can charge at 25W over &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, though the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/\">iPhone Air</a> is limited to 20W.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"camera\">Camera</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to have a single 48-megapixel Wide Angle camera at the back, with no upgrade rumored. The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; doesn't have a Camera Control button, and there's no word on whether Apple will bring it to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models got an upgraded 18-megapixel Center Stage front-facing camera, but rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will continue to use the same 12-megapixel front-facing camera as the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"modem\">Modem</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will adopt Apple's C1X modem, the modem chip that Apple first debuted in the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;. The C1X modem is faster and more efficient than the C1 modem that Apple used in the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple says the C1X modem is up to 2x faster than the C1, and it is far more energy efficient than Qualcomm modems.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"no_n1_chip\">No N1 Chip</h2>\r<br/>\nWhile the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models received Apple's new Wi-Fi and Bluetooth \"N1\" networking chip, leaked Apple code suggests the chip will not be included in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e in order to keep costs down.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;599, and no price changes are expected for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"launch_date\">Launch Date</h2>\r<br/>\nRumors suggest that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is going to come in the first half of 2026, and Apple could stick to the February release timing. The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; was introduced via press release on February 19, 2025, so we're probably not waiting on an event for the 17e.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor that reason, it could come anytime in February, though there's also a possibility that Apple will hold it until the March or April timeframe. In late March or early April, Apple plans to release iOS 26.4 with a new version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, along with several updated home products.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-17e/\">Apple&#039;s Next iPhone: What to Expect From the 2026 iPhone 17e</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-next-iphone-what-to-expect-from-the-2026-iphone-17e.2476366/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple today released new firmware for the Magic Keyboards designed for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>. The firmware for the M4/M5 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; model has a version number of 0750.0220.0304, up from the prior 0680.0220.0301 firmware, while the firmware for the M3 &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; model has a version number of 0400.0140.0303, up from 0350.0135.0303.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/magic-keyboard-green.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-977584\" />\r<br/>\nThe new firmware is available for both the 11-inch and 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; Magic Keyboard options that Apple sells for the M4 and M5 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models, as well as the version that Apple sells for the M3 &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple overhauled the Magic Keyboard in May 2024 alongside the launch of the M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. The updated keyboard has the same floating cantilevered design as the prior version, but it includes a dedicated row of function keys, along with a larger glass trackpad.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMagic Keyboard firmware updates are infrequent, and there is no method for manually refreshing the software. New firmware is installed automatically when the keyboard is attached to an &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; that is connected to the internet.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYou can check the firmware version of your Magic Keyboard by opening up the Settings app and going to General > About > Magic Keyboard.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-keyboard/\">Magic Keyboard</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/20/ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-firmware-update/\">Apple Releases New Firmware for iPad Pro and iPad Air Magic Keyboards</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-firmware-for-ipad-pro-and-ipad-air-magic-keyboards.2476358/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The new version features a limited edition icy blue glow colorway, providing a subtle glow-in-the-dark effect that can be seen between the titanium links of the band.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/nomad-stratos-blue-band-main.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032991\" />\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-14535369?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fstratos-band-black-hardware-icy-blue-glow\">Available for &#36;189</a>, the Stratos Apple Watch band combines the look of titanium with the comfort of fluoroelastomer. The band features outer links made from metal injection molded Grade 4 titanium, paired with molded FKM material on the interior.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/nomad-stratos-blue-band-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032992\" />\r<br/>\nThe fluoroelastomer connects each titanium link, offering flexibility and comfort that's unavailable with traditional metal bands, including Apple's own stainless steel Link Bracelet. The FKM material peeks through the rounded titanium links, adding visual interest and space for ventilation to bolster moisture evaporation and breathability.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/nomad-stratos-blue-band-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032993\" />\r<br/>\nNomad makes the Stratos band in Silver and Black titanium, with black, ultra orange, volt, and icy blue glow FKM color options. The latter is the new color, and we were able to try out the band before it launched. Nomad's imagery largely depicts the band in the dark with a rich, blue glow coming from the fluoroelastomer underlayer, but the actual blue shade in the light is much subtler. The color is a soft, muted blue that's close to white from a distance.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nExposing the band to sunlight or bright light produces a glow effect, but it's faint. The FKM material of the Stratos band is beneath the titanium and against the wrist, so it sees little light exposure. Light is needed for the glow to work, which means the overall result is subdued. For the most part, expect the band to look more white than blue between the links, but you will see thin lines of the blue color peeking through the links in the dark.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/nomad-stratos-blue-band-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032994\" />\r<br/>\nThe band is comfortable on the wrist, and it's simple to remove links with the included tool to get a custom fit. The magnetic clasp is easy to close, and it only opens when squeezing the sides of the buckle, so it should remain secure. The clasp can pinch the skin when it's being closed, so be wary of that when putting the band on.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/nomad-stratos-blue-band-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032995\" />\r<br/>\nHaving the fluoroelastomer underneath the titanium makes for a softer feel on the wrist than just titanium alone, and Nomad's band options are far cheaper than Apple's similar bands.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYou can order the Icy Blue Glow Stratos Band <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-14535369?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fstratos-band-black-hardware-icy-blue-glow\">from the Nomad website for &#36;189</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nomad/\">Nomad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/20/nomad-stratos-icy-blue-apple-watch-band/\">Nomad Launches Hybrid Titanium Apple Watch Band in New &#039;Icy Blue Glow&#039; Color</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nomad-launches-hybrid-titanium-apple-watch-band-in-new-icy-blue-glow-color.2476354/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

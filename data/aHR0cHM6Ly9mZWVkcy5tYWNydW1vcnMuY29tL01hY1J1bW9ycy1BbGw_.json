These alerts are sent over available connectivity, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, and, when available, mobile data. Apple can deliver Enhanced Safety Alerts to your current region, which is determined using your device location. A region may be a country, or for some countries (such as the US), a region may be a group of states. Your Apple device can be associated with this region. Apple does not store information about your device location in a region.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEnhanced Safety Alerts are turned on by default. You can disable or re-enable Enhanced Safety Alerts by going to Settings > Notifications > Enhanced Alerts > Enhanced Safety Alerts, then tapping to turn one or more types of Enhanced Safety Alerts on or off. Enhanced Safety Alerts are delivered by Apple and will appear and sound different to a Government Alert sent by your local government.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nImprove Alert Delivery uses your approximate location to improve the timeliness and reliability of Enhanced Safety Alerts. For example, Earthquake Alerts might be delivered quicker and more reliably when Improve Alert Delivery is turned on. Apple does not store your approximate location. You can enable Improve Alert Delivery in Settings > Notifications > Enhanced Alerts > Enhanced Safety Alerts > Improve Alert Delivery.\r<br/>\nTo receive Enhanced Alerts, you must have enabled Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > System Services > Alerts & Shortcuts Automation.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Other Features</h2>\r<br/>\nThere are several other new features coming in iOS 26.2, such as a Liquid Glass slider for the Lock Screen and Live Translation support for the AirPods in the European Union. More information can be found in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-2-beta-features/\">iOS 26.2 beta 1 guide</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"download_ios_26.2\">Download iOS 26.2</h2>\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 beta 2 is available for developers right now, but a public beta is likely coming later this week.

      "content": "Aqara today launched its latest sensor, debuting the Presence Multi-Sensor FP300. Aqara’s sensor is able to determine when someone is in the room, providing a useful way to control HomeKit-connected lights and devices.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/aqara-presence-sensor.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1070\" height=\"602\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026662\" />\r<br/>\nThere are dual mmWave and passive infrared sensors inside the FP300, and in our testing prior to launch, the sensors worked well to detect presence and keep lights on even when sitting still.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA wide 120-degree field of view provides coverage of most of a room depending on where the sensor is located, and Aqara added extra sensors for ambient light, humidity, and temperature. It’s handy to have extra sensors for keeping an eye on room conditions or activating scenes based on parameters like light levels.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUnlike prior Aqara sensors that detect presence, the FP300 is battery powered so it can be placed anywhere, and it’s also more affordable. At &#36;50, it’s an easier buy for rooms where you want better control over when the lights are on and off. The sensor is small and unobtrusive with a rotatable base, so it can be placed almost anywhere. It comes with screws, adhesive and a magnet for mounting it on the wall or another surface.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCompared to the more expensive FP2 Presence Sensor from Aqara, the FP300 is not as advanced and does not include multi-person detection, sleep tracking, or fall detection capabilities.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are plenty of sensors that can detect movement to turn on lights or activate other devices, but those mostly work by detecting movement upfront and then turning the lights off after a set period. Aqara’s Presence Sensor works much better than these static motion sensors. It keeps the lights on inside the closet for the entire duration that I’m in there before turning them off again. It has a range of almost 20 feet, so it works in most rooms.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe FP300 is able to connect to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> using Matter, and it also includes Zigbee and Thread protocol support. When used in Thread mode, it can connect with Apple Home without a hub, but Zigbee mode requires an Aqara Zigbee Hub.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt supports &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; automations, so you can create actions for turning on lights or other devices when you enter the room, or use features like the ambient light detection to automate your lights when it starts to get dark.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCombining the included sensors is useful too. You can set up an automation for turning the lights on in the dark only when presence is detected, or activating the thermostat only if it’s over a certain temperature while someone is in the room. Aqara designed the sensor with AI, and it can adjust detection sensitivity to the room where it is placed.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are two CR2450 batteries inside, which will need to be replaced approximately once every two years when it’s connected via Thread.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Presence Sensor FP300 can be <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0FG2MD3YP\">purchased from Amazon</a> for &#36;50 as of today.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aqara/\">Aqara</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/12/aqara-fp-300-presence-sensor/\">Aqara Launches Matter-Supported FP300 Presence Sensor</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/aqara-launches-matter-supported-fp300-presence-sensor.2471044/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "The second beta of macOS 26.2 introduces a new Edge Light feature that's designed for video calls on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> and other video calling platforms. It adds a light border around the edges of your Mac's display, providing improved lighting. Apple says that it is meant to help you look your best on video calls. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/apple-edge-light-macos-tahoe-26-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1293\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026659\" />\r<br/>\nEdge Light mimics a ring light, eliminating the need for a separate device. It can provide illumination when you're in a dark room, and customize the light to match the brightness of the ambient lighting. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Mac's Apple Neural Engine is able to detect your face, relative size, and location in the video frame to position the light appropriately, and it will fade out to allow you to access content on your screen when needed by detecting your mouse cursor. You can adjust the color of the light using a slider that transitions between warm and cool options. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEdge Light can be accessed in the settings of video conferencing apps alongside other options like backgrounds, Portrait mode, Studio Light, and Voice Isolation. The feature is available on Macs that support Apple silicon, and it works with both webcams and external cameras that are connected.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOn Macs from 2024 and later, Edge Light can turn on automatically when ambient lighting in the room drops.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDevelopers can try Edge Light today, and macOS Tahoe 26.2 is set to launch to the public in December. <div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/\">macOS Tahoe 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-tahoe.250\">macOS Tahoe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/12/apple-macos-tahoe-26-2-edge-light/\">macOS Tahoe 26.2 Gets Edge Light Feature for Video Calls</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-tahoe-26-2-gets-edge-light-feature-for-video-calls.2471041/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

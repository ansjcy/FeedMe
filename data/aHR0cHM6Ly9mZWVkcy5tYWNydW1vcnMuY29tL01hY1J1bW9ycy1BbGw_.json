      "content": "Apple on Monday invited selected journalists and content creators to a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/apple-announces-special-event-in-new-york/\">\"special Apple Experience\" on Wednesday, March 4</a> in New York, London, and Shanghai. And now, rumors are surfacing about Apple's broader plans for that week.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Apple-Announces-Special-Event-in-New-York-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1888\" height=\"1063\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036546\" />\r<br/>\n<em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber today <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/17/apple-special-experience-march-4\">guessed</a> that Apple will announce new products on a day-by-day basis from Monday, March 2 through Wednesday, March 4:<blockquote>What strikes me is that March 4 — the \"experience\" day — is a Wednesday. So my spitball guess is that they announce all these products via Newsroom press releases, day-by-day. Like, say, the iPhone 17e on Monday, new iPad(s) on Tuesday, and new MacBooks on Wednesday. And then the \"experience\" will be a hands-on thing with in-person demos.</blockquote>In response to Gruber's post, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/2023924227632754717\">said</a> product announcements on the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of that week is indeed \"exactly\" what he is expecting, based on what he has heard from his sources.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGurman does not expect a typical Apple Event live stream for the new products, with the announcements likely to occur in the form of press releases on the Apple Newsroom website instead. However, there could still be a short video prepared for each new product, and the media would get hands-on time with the new products.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple has announced new products on a Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday basis multiple times in the past, including in March 2019 (new iPad mini and iPad Air, iMac, and AirPods models) and in October 2024 (new iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro models).  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe following Apple products are rumored to be coming soon:<ul><li><strong>Lower-Cost MacBook:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/02/12-9-inch-macbook-spring-2026-rumor/\">A18 Pro chip</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/02/12-9-inch-macbook-spring-2026-rumor/\">12.9-inch display</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/low-cost-macbook-yellow-green-blue-pink/\">fun color options</a>.</li>\r<br/>\n<li><strong>iPhone 17e:</strong> A spec-bumped successor to the iPhone 16e, with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/05/iphone-17e-and-ipad-12-rumors/\">rumored upgrades</a> including an A19 chip, MagSafe, and Apple's C1X and N1 wireless chips. The device will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/05/iphone-17e-and-ipad-12-rumors/\">apparently have a notch</a> despite earlier rumors mentioning a Dynamic Island, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/iphone-17e-launch-imminent-with-four-features/\">pricing will continue to start at &#36;599</a> in the United States.</li>\r<br/>\n<li><strong>iPad Air:</strong> M3 chip → <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/ipad-12-and-ipad-air-8-reportedly-coming-soon/\">M4 chip</a>.</li>\r<br/>\n<li><strong>iPad:</strong> A16 chip → <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/ipad-12-and-ipad-air-8-reportedly-coming-soon/\">A18 chip</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/10/ipad-12-a19-chip/\">A19 chip</a>.</li>\r<br/>\n<li><strong>MacBook Air:</strong> M4 chip → M5 chip.</li>\r<br/>\n<li><strong>MacBook Pro:</strong> M4 Pro and M4 Max chips → M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/16/new-14-inch-macbook-pro-two-key-upgrades/\">PCIe 5.0 support</a> for faster SSD speeds.</li>\r<br/>\n<li><strong>Mac Studio:</strong> M4 Max and M3 Ultra chips → <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/04/mac-studio-m5-ultra-2026/\">M5 Max and M5 Ultra chips</a>.</li>\r<br/>\n<li><strong>Studio Display:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/\">27-inch screen with mini-LED backlighting</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/apple-studio-display-2-unusual-feature-rumor/\">up to 90Hz</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/\">120Hz refresh rate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/\">HDR support</a>, and either an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/\">A19 chip</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/a19-pro-chip-coming-to-studio-display-2/\">A19 Pro chip</a>.</li>\r<br/>\n<li><strong>Home Hub:</strong> An <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/five-all-new-apple-products-this-year/\">all-new smart home hub</a> featuring the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/google-gemini-next-generation-siri/\">more personalized version of Siri</a>, a 6-inch to 7-inch square display, an A18 chip for Apple Intelligence, FaceTime, and more. Place it on a table or mount it on a wall.</li>\r<br/>\n<li><strong>Security Camera:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-home-security-camera/\">Apple-designed, HomeKit-enabled security camera</a> accessory to be sold alongside the new smart home hub.</li></ul>In addition, rumors about new Apple TV and HomePod mini models have been circulating for more than a year, but there is still no sign of them.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn the end, we might only get three of these new products in the first week of March, with the most likely possibilities being the lower-cost MacBook with an iPhone chip, the iPhone 17e, and perhaps either an updated iPad Air or entry-level iPad.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe invite graphic for the upcoming \"Apple Experience\" includes a colorful Apple logo with yellow, green, and blue discs, and Gurman previously reported that Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/low-cost-macbook-yellow-green-blue-pink/\">tested those three colors plus pink</a> for the MacBook with an iPhone chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<em>MacRumors</em> will be attending the \"Apple Experience,\" so stay tuned for our coverage.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/apple-announcements-first-week-of-march/\">Rumor: Apple to Announce Multiple New Products in First Week of March</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rumor-apple-to-announce-multiple-new-products-in-first-week-of-march.2477869/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

In iOS 26.3 and earlier versions of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, there was a section for the blood oxygen level, but the graph did not include a blood oxygen measurement.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036661\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/ios-26-4-vitals-app-blood-oxygen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Camera</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the Settings section of the Camera app, there is a new \"Audio Zoom\" option. The feature causes recorded audio to focus on the subject when the camera is zoomed while recording a video. It can be turned on or off, depending on the audio settings you prefer.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/ios-26-4-audio-zoom.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036701\" />\r<br/>\n<h2>CarPlay</h2>\r<br/>\nWe found mentions of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/ios-26-4-carplay-video-apple-tv/\">Apple TV support for CarPlay</a>, indicating that Apple will eventually allow users to watch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> content through their car's dashboard when the vehicle is not in motion.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034782\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Apple-CarPlay-iOS-26-Tight-Crop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2880\" height=\"1620\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAt WWDC 2025, Apple said that it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/ios-26-4-carplay-video-apple-tv/\">would add support</a> for AirPlaying video content to a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a> display, and it appears that feature could come in the near future.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Apple Music</h2>\r<br/>\nA song can be added to multiple playlists at the same time in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> app. In the add to playlist interface, there is a list button, and tapping it allows you to select multiple playlists at the same time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/ios-26-4-multiple-playlists.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036700\" />\r<br/>\n<h2>Hotspot Data</h2>\r<br/>\nApple moved the location of hotspot data usage. Rather than having data usage metrics tucked away under Cellular, you'll see how much data you've used right in the Personal Hotspot section.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/ios-26-4-hotspot-data-usage.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036697\" />\r<br/>\n<h2>Live Captions</h2>\r<br/>\nChinese (Taiwan) is a new language option for Live Captions in the Accessibility section.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/ios-26-4-live-captions.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036702\" />\r<br/>\n<h2>Passcode Settings</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> and Passcode section of the Settings app, when you enter a passcode to access your options, the text is now center aligned instead of left aligned.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/ios-26-4-passcode.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036698\" />\r<br/>\n<h2>Shortcuts</h2>\r<br/>\nApple added a Set Charge Limit action to the Shortcuts app. It sets a battery charge limit for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/ios-26-4-shortcuts-charge-limit.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2432\" height=\"1368\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036699\" />\r<br/>\n<h2>Read More</h2>\r<br/>\nFor more on all of the new features in iOS 26.4, we have a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-4-beta-features/\">dedicated iOS 26.4 features guide</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/ios-26-4-beta-tidbits/\">iOS 26.4 Beta Tidbits: Hidden Features You May Have Missed</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-4-beta-tidbits-hidden-features-you-may-have-missed.2477866/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/ios-26-4-public-beta-1/\">first beta of iOS 26.4</a> is available to developers and public beta testers, and the software includes no new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> features. There were expectations of at least some new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; capabilities because of how long the delays have been and persistent rumors suggesting Apple was targeting an iOS 26.4 release, but we'll have to wait longer for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; updates.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Sad-Siri-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-994723\" />\r<br/>\nAfter Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/\">announced a delay</a> for the &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; in March 2025, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple had set an internal launch target <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/apple-intelligence-siri-spring-2026/\">for iOS 26.4</a>. He repeated the iOS 26.4 timeline in several subsequent reports, and even <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/25/siri-google-gemini-release-date/\">at the end of January</a>, he suggested that Apple would unveil the more personalized version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; in February.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple seemed to be aiming for an iOS 26.4 launch until right before the first beta came out, because just last week, Gurman said the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; update wouldn't be coming in iOS 26.4 after all. Apple apparently ran into development issues and the new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has reportedly been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/siri-features-delayed-ios-26-4/\">delayed until iOS 26.5 or iOS 27</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGurman said the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features will be spread across several upcoming iOS releases. Some or all of the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features could be introduced in iOS 26.5, or Apple might wait for iOS 27, which will be previewed in June 2026 at WWDC.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple first showed off the &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; at the 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference, and it was supposed to come in iOS 18. Apple had to upgrade &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s architecture to make the promised functionality work, and so far, that's taken over a year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is apparently taking too long to respond to requests, and some queries aren't processed properly, which is what led to the iOS 26.4 &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; delay. Engineers are apparently using iOS 26.5 for further &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; testing right now, so some functionality could come in that update. There's still a possibility that new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features will be introduced in a later iOS 26.4 beta, but that's not guaranteed.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple has been working to add personalization, onscreen awareness, and the ability for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to do more in and between apps. Not all of the features are working reliably and Apple is said to be having continual issues with accuracy.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAfter the report about the missed iOS 26.4 timeline, Apple confirmed to <em>CNBC</em> that the new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; would still be coming at some point in 2026. Apple has never given a timeline more specific than 2026, so there hasn't been a second actual delay, just a disappointment based on rumors of an iOS 26.4 launch.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSince it's only February, Apple has until December to meet the 2026 launch target that it publicly promised. Even if the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features are delayed until iOS 27, Apple will still meet its goal. Gurman claims that Apple executives are reluctant to push the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s debut beyond spring 2026, so an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a> launch could still happen.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/ios-26-4-no-new-siri-features/\">iOS 26.4 Beta Launches Without Apple Intelligence Siri Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-4-beta-launches-without-apple-intelligence-siri-features.2477859/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Google is expanding its cross-platform file sharing feature to additional Android devices, allowing them to transfer files to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> using the AirDrop protocol. AirDrop support for Quick Share is coming to the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold over the next few days.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027746\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/android-iphone-airdrop-quickshare.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1353\" height=\"761\" />\r<br/>\nGoogle announced Quick Share compatibility with AirDrop <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/20/iphone-android-airdrop-quickshare/\">back in November</a>, but the feature was initially limited to the newest Pixel 10 devices.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith <a href=\"https://store.google.com/magazine/pixel_drop\">AirDrop interoperability</a>, Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 devices can transfer files to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, or Mac, and it works the same way as Apple device to Apple device AirDrop transfers. No internet connection is required.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTo accept files from a Pixel smartphone, Apple device users need to change their AirDrop visibility to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes.\" With the setting enabled, a file coming from an Android user looks identical to an AirDrop file from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, with the same notification and option to accept. Files are saved in the appropriate location, with a photo going to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app or a document going to the Files app.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTo receive files from an Apple user, the Pixel user will also need to turn on the Everyone for 10 minutes setting or enter into Receive mode on the Quick Share page. Files are saved in the Files app.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAccording to Google, Quick Share and AirDrop interoperability was designed with <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2025/11/android-quick-share-support-for-airdrop-security.html\">a multi-layered security approach</a> to ensure a safe sharing experience regardless of platform. There's a secure sharing channel, built-in platform protections for Android and iOS, and a consent requirement before a file is received.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nConnections between devices are direct and peer-to-peer, so data is not routed through a server. For file transfers in both directions, the Apple device or the Pixel device displays the other person's device name for verification purposes.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airdrop/\">AirDrop</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-pixel/\">Google Pixel</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/android-iphone-airdrop-pixel-9-support/\">Android-to-iPhone AirDrop Transfers Now Supported on Pixel 9</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/android-to-iphone-airdrop-transfers-now-supported-on-pixel-9.2477858/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The feature is currently offered by select automakers, such as Audi, BMW, Hyundai, Kia, Genesis, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo, and Toyota is now rolling out support as well.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Toyota-Rav4-Car-Key-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036635\" />\r<br/>\nAccording to a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rav4club/comments/1r5138w/comment/o5fwtkt/\">Reddit post</a>, select trims of the 2026 Toyota RAV4 support the Apple Wallet car key feature in the United States, at a minimum. We have yet to confirm if the feature is rolling out to any of Toyota's other 2026 model year vehicles.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nToyota's implementation of the feature utilizes Ultra Wideband technology, allowing you to simply approach the vehicle, open the door, and start the vehicle, all with your iPhone in your pocket or your Apple Watch on your wrist. This passive entry functionality requires an iPhone 11 or newer* or an Apple Watch Series 6 or newer.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA few months ago, <em>MacRumors</em> was first to report that Toyota was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/toyota-to-gain-apple-car-keys-support/\">planning to offer Apple Wallet car keys</a>, so this rollout was expected. It appears that the feature requires a Toyota Remote Connect subscription, which starts at &#36;15 per month.

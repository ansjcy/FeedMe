      "content": "Apple is testing iOS 26.2, a new version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a> that’s going to come out right around mid-December. iOS 26.2 is going to bring big changes to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users in Japan, but there are also quite a few feature tweaks available for everyone. We’ve rounded up all of the new features your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will get in iOS 26.2.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/iOS-26.2-Glass-Slider-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027937\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"reminders\">Reminders</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the Reminders app, there’s a new option to have an alarm go off when a reminder is due. Setting up an alarm can be done by toggling on the “Urgent” option when creating a reminder.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025665\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-alarm-reminders.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen a Reminder alarm activates, it displays a snooze option or a slide to stop option. If you snooze it, it will show a countdown on the Lock Screen that includes an option to complete the reminder or reschedule it. Apple distinguishes Reminders alarms from standard alarms with a new blue color.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple provides a splash screen letting users know about the feature, plus a small banner that shows up when you go to add a new entry in the Reminders app after updating to iOS 26.2.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027254\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-b3-reminders.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"lock_screen\">Lock Screen</h2>\r<br/>\nThere is a Liquid Glass slider on the Lock Screen that lets you customize the appearance of the clock. When using the “Glass” option, you can use the slider to make the time look almost entirely clear, or give it a more frosted look.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025676\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-liquid-glass-toggle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThere continues to be a separate Solid toggle that turns off the Liquid Glass appearance for the clock entirely if you want to opt for a much more opaque design, and you can also still use the color options for the clock.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025677\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-liquid-glass-slider-extremes.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"liquid_glass_settings\">Liquid Glass Settings</h2>\r<br/>\nWhen using the new Liquid Glass “Tinted” option that reduces transparency, there’s a warning that the Tinted option cannot be used in tandem with the Reduce Transparency and Increase Contrast Accessibility settings.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027253\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-b3-tinted-mode.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nTurning on Tinted mode is able to turn off Reduce Transparency and Increase Contrast automatically. In the prior betas, there was no option to turn on Tinted mode without turning off these features manually.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"airdrop\">AirDrop</h2>\r<br/>\nApple added <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/ios-26-2-airdrop-codes/\">new AirDrop functionality</a>, providing a way for two people to share files temporarily without having to add one another as contacts.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027227\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-airdrop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 includes an option to generate a one-time AirDrop code, which can then be shared with someone who is not in your contacts list. The code allows file exchanges over AirDrop for a 30-day period.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPeople you have shared a one-time code with can be managed by opening up the Settings app, selecting the General section, choosing AirDrop, and tapping on “Manage Known AirDrop Contacts.”\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"apple_music\">Apple Music</h2>\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> now supports offline lyrics, so you can see a song’s lyrics when not connected to Wi-Fi or cellular.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"sleep_score\">Sleep Score</h2>\r<br/>\nWith iOS 26.2 and watchOS 26.2, Apple has adjusted the ranges for the Sleep Score feature that it introduced earlier this year. The new Sleep Score numbers better match how people might be feeling after a night of sleep.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025635\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/watchos-26-2-sleep-score.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThese are the new scores:\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n <li><strong>Very Low</strong> - 0–40 (previously 0–29)</li>\r<br/>\n <li><strong>Low</strong> - 41–60 (previously 30–49)</li>\r<br/>\n <li><strong>OK</strong> - 61–80 (previously 50–69)</li>\r<br/>\n <li><strong>High</strong> - 81–95 (previously 70–89)</li>\r<br/>\n <li><strong>Very High</strong> - 96–100 (previously 90–100)</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nThe “Very High” rank used to be “Excellent,” but Apple changed the name to be more in line with the other labels.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSleep Scores are available on all Apple Watch models compatible with watchOS 26.2 and can be found in the Health app on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Apple designed Sleep Score to provide an overall sense of sleep patterns, so users can identify habits that might impact their sleep.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSleep Score takes into account sleep duration, bedtime, and interruptions to assign a nightly score that represents sleep quality. Duration is worth 50 points, bedtime is worth 30, and interruptions (times woken up in the night) are worth 20, for a total of 100 possible points each night.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"podcasts\">Podcasts</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Podcasts app adds support for three new features, including automatically created chapters, options to see mentions of other podcasts from the transcript and the player, and access to links mentioned in a podcast on the episode page.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025681\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-podcasts.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"passwords\">Passwords</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the Settings section of the Passwords app, there’s an option to manage websites where passwords are not saved when signing in.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025696\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-passwords-excluded-websites.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"5541\" height=\"3117\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"airpods_live_translation_for_eu\">AirPods Live Translation for EU</h2>\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 expands AirPods Live Translation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/04/ios-26-2-expands-live-translation-on-airpods-to-eu/\">to the European Union</a>. Apple had to delay the feature in the EU to complete the engineering work needed to comply with the requirements of the Digital Markets Act.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025657\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/AirPods-Live-Translation.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br/>\nAirPods Live Translation works with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/\">AirPods Pro 3</a>, AirPods Pro 2, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a> with ANC. It is available in English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional Mandarin), Japanese, and Korean at the current time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"freeform\">Freeform</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Freeform app now supports Tables.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025697\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-freeform-tables.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"weather\">Weather</h2>\r<br/>\nThere is code suggesting that the Weather app now supports relative time for alerts like “next Friday,” or “next Tuesday” in reference to upcoming rain or weather conditions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"apple_news\">Apple News</h2>\r<br/>\nApple updated the design of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news/\">Apple News</a>, adding quick access top buttons for categories like sports, puzzles, politics, business, and food.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025698\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-apple-news-update.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThere’s also a dedicated tab for Following, which has been decoupled from the search interface.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"flash_for_alerts\">Flash for Alerts</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Flash for Alerts option in the Accessibility section of the Settings app now allows users to have the screen flash. Previously, this setting was limited to the LED on the back of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025699\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-flash-alert.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nUsers can swap to the screen flash or have both flash at the same time when notifications come in.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"enhanced_safety_alerts\">Enhanced Safety Alerts</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the Notifications section of the Settings app, there’s an Enhanced Safety Alerts section for managing earthquake alerts, imminent threat alerts, and activating improved alert delivery, a feature that uses location to improve the reliability of alerts.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025700\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-safety-alerts-enhanced.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"measure_app\">Measure App</h2>\r<br/>\nApple’s Measure app now features a Liquid Glass design for the level, with two Liquid Glass bubbles instead of white circles.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026669\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-measure-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"games_app\">Games App</h2>\r<br/>\nThere’s now an option to sort games in the Games app Library by size, in addition to Name and Recent.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026670\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-games-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThe Games app also supports navigation with a controller and real-time updates to challenge scores during gameplay.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027255\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-b3-games-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"carplay\">CarPlay</h2>\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a> now app supports disabling pinned messages in the Messages app for drivers who prefer the classic Messages view that was available before iOS 26.2.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005145\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/CarPlay-Pinned-Messages.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"menu_animations\">Menu Animations</h2>\r<br/>\nFor pop-out menus that expand from a corner button, there’s a quicker, bouncier animation that looks like the animation that Apple showed off at WWDC.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Liquid Glass animation in iOS 26.2 beta 2 is amazing, feels like what was shown off at WWDC <a href=\"https://t.co/J6YruZz4cR\">pic.twitter.com/J6YruZz4cR</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1988746455478415685?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"privacy\">Privacy</h2>\r<br/>\nWhen you access your Apple Account for the first time after installing iOS 26.2, you’ll see an alert letting you know that Apple’s privacy information for Apple Accounts has been updated to better explain how personal information is collected and used by Apple.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027252\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-b3-apple-account.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"iphone_changes_in_japan\">iPhone Changes in Japan</h2>\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"siri_replacement\">Siri Replacement</h3>\r<br/>\nApple is laying the groundwork for a new option that will let &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in Japan choose a different default voice assistant. A press and hold gesture on the Side Button only activates ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>‌ in the current version of &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, but there are multiple references to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/ios-26-2-iphone-users-japan-siri/\">new Side Button behavior</a> in the beta.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in Japan will be able to select a new voice-based conversation app to activate with the Side Button, allowing alternative assistants like Gemini or Alexa to be used on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/ios-26-2-iphone-users-japan-siri/\">Developer documentation confirms</a> that it will only be available for Japanese Apple Accounts owned by people living in Japan.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"search_engine_choice\">Search Engine Choice</h3>\r<br/>\nAfter installing iOS 26.2, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in Japan <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/05/japan-safari-choice-ios-26-2/\">will be prompted</a> to select a preferred search engine. Options include Bing, Google, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo Japan, or Ecosia, the same options available globally in the Safari settings. In most other countries, Google is the default search engine and there is no prompt to choose a different option when the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ first starts up.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-961055\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/apple-search-engine-settings-safari.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nWhile ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ users outside of Japan can choose one of the other options, doing so requires going into the Safari section of the Settings app to make a change.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"third_party_app_stores\">Third Party App Stores</h3>\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 will allow &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in Japan to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/05/ios-26-2-third-party-app-stores-japan/\">install alternative app marketplaces</a>, similar to the European Union.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"texas_app_store_changes\">Texas App Store Changes</h2>\r<br/>\nWith iOS 26.2, Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/04/ios-26-2-texas-age-verification-law/\">adding tools for developers</a> that will help them comply with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> Accountability Act that goes into effect in Texas in 2026. Apple users in Texas will need to confirm whether they are 18 years or older when creating an Apple Account, and parents will need to provide consent for their children’s &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; downloads and in-app transactions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple will share user age range information with developers, and developers will need to implement systems for notifying parents about significant app changes and allowing parents to revoke a child’s access to an app at any time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"bonus:_ipados_26.2_multitasking\">Bonus: iPadOS 26.2 Multitasking</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the iPadOS 26.2, Apple is expanding on the updated multitasking that it introduced in iPadOS 26.1. There’s now a option to drag and drop apps from the App Library, Dock, and Spotlight into Slide Over and tiled views, restoring some functionality that was removed in the iPadOS 18 to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a> transition.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022261\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/ipados-26-1-slide-over.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h2>\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 is available on all iPhones that support &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"release_date\">Release Date</h2>\r<br/>\nWe’re expecting Apple to release iOS 26.2 in December, sometime between December 9 and December 16.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-2-beta-everything-new/\">iOS 26.2 Will Bring 10+ New Features to Your iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-2-will-bring-10-new-features-to-your-iphone.2471681/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Several iPads are slated to get updates in 2026, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, low-cost <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; could be updated early in the year, sometime around the March or April timeframe.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/m3-ipad-air-blue-hue.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996976\" />\r<br/>\nWe've heard a limited amount about the new tablet, but it sounds like there won't be a major overhaul, with Apple primarily focusing on internals.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"design_and_display\">Design and Display</h2>\r<br/>\nNo design changes are rumored for the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, so we can expect the same 11-inch and 13-inch size options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is thicker and heavier than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, and it uses a standard LED display instead of OLED technology. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will eventually be upgraded to OLED, but for now, the higher-end display technology will remain limited to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; also doesn't support ProMotion, and there's no sign that Apple is planning to update its middle-tier tablet with the functionality.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will continue to feature USB-C, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> top button, and the same front and rear camera options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt's possible there will be a new color option, but it's not guaranteed with a minor refresh. No new accessories are rumored, and it will continue to work with the Magic Keyboard and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> Pro.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"m4_chip\">M4 Chip</h2>\r<br/>\nApple has been updating the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; with an M-series chip that's a generation behind the chip in the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. Since the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; was updated in October 2025 with the M5, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is set to get the M4 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe M3 in the current &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and the M4 chip are both built on a 3-nanometer process, but the M4 has an updated process that brings speed and efficiency improvements.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are up to 10 CPU cores instead of 8, the Neural Engine is faster, and there's more memory bandwidth. The GPU is also more power efficient for potential battery gains. The M4 CPU is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3-vs-m4/\">up to 30 percent faster</a> than the M3 CPU, while the GPU is up to 21 percent faster.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn actual use, you may not see much of a difference between the M3 and M4 on the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, though you might experience modest improvements with system intensive games and tasks like video editing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; already supports <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, and the next-generation model will continue to do so. Apple upped the RAM in some &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models, but there's no word on whether that same change will come to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. Current models feature 8GB RAM, the minimum for &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"charging\">Charging</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; was upgraded with fast charge functionality with the update to the M5 chip, and that's something that could trickle down to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"n1_networking_chip\">N1 Networking Chip</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and other tablets released in 2026 will probably adopt the N1 networking chip that Apple first introduced in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe N1 chip is an Apple-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip that offers connectivity and efficiency improvements compared to the third-party chips that Apple has used in previous devices. The N1 supports the latest Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6 technology.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe current &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; offers Wi-Fi 6E support, so the next-generation model could see faster Wi-Fi speeds on compatible networks with Wi-Fi 7.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"apple_modem\">Apple Modem</h2>\r<br/>\nApple used the C1X in the M5 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and it's likely the cellular versions of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will get that same modem chip. The C1X is an upgraded variant of the C1, Apple's first in-house modem chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt offers performance on par with Qualcomm chips, though 5G connectivity is limited to sub-6GHz with no support for mmWave 5G. That's not an issue on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, because the current version of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; doesn't support mmWave.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's modem chips are much more power efficient than Qualcomm modem chips, and are able to better integrate with other &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; components.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h2>\r<br/>\nThere are no rumors of a price increase, so the 11-inch model is expected to continue to start at &#36;599, while the 13-inch model will start at &#36;799.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"launch_date\">Launch Date</h2>\r<br/>\nWe're expecting the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; to come out sometime around March or April 2026. Apple could be planning to hold a spring event, since there are several products that are rumored to be launching in that timeframe.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-air-2026/\">iPad Air 2026: All the Rumors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-air-2026-all-the-rumors.2471672/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

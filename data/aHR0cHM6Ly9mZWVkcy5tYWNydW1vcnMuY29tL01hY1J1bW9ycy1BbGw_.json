      "content": "Apple reportedly tested a version of the first-generation AirPods with bright, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 5c-like colored charging cases.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/airpods-color-prototypes.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1031010\" />\r<br/>\nThe images, shared by the Apple leaker and prototype collector known as \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/\">Kosutami</a>,\" claim to show first-generation AirPods prototypes with pink and yellow exterior casings. The interior of the charging case and the earbuds themselves remain white.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThey seem close to some of the color options offered for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5c, which came in blue, green, pink, yellow and white. Apple has only ever released AirPods in white.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Christmas post  Abandoned iPhone 5c colored AirPods 1st gen prototype. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/appleinternal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#appleinternal</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Y2wzZTxgLC\">pic.twitter.com/Y2wzZTxgLC</a></p>&mdash; Kosutami (@Kosutami_Ito) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/2003859001721926068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn 2023, Kosutami <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/apple-prototyped-airpods-in-five-color-options/\">shared images</a> of AirPods in pink. Apple apparently developed five different color options for AirPods to approximately match the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 7, but decided not to move forward with the idea.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSome users have sought after AirPods in different color options for several years. While Apple was seemingly only ever considering offering the charging case in different color ways, it is interesting to know that the company got as far as prototyping distinct color options for the device to match various &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models. Today, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a> are the only AirPods to have been offered in different color options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nKosutami previously shared images of various Apple prototypes, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/07/more-black-vision-pro-parts-surface-online/\">all-black Vision Pro parts</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/magsafe-charger-prototype-reveals-abandoned-design/\">earlier version</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> charging puck, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/exclusive-first-look-finewoven-apple-watch-band/\">FineWoven Apple Watch bands</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/prototype-shows-why-apple-abandoned-airpower/\">functional AirPower charging mat</a>, an unreleased <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/14/collectors-discover-unreleased-apple-accessory/\">\"Magic Charger\" accessory</a>, and more.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/\">Kosutami</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/prototypes/\">Prototypes</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Neutral)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/27/apple-tested-airpods-in-bright-colors/\">Apple Tested AirPods in Bright Colors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tested-airpods-in-bright-colors.2475257/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays from MacRumors! News in the Apple world has unsurprisingly been relatively slow over the past week, but Apple's upcoming foldable iPhone managed to make its way back into the news, while we also shared updates on current and future Apple TV news.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/top-stories-2025-12-27.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031007\" />\r<br/>\niOS 26.3 will be bringing some new features, particularly for users in the EU, so we'll look for additional betas and eventually a public release once the new year rolls around, and read on below for all the details on these stories and more!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Top Stories</h2>\r<br/>\n<h3>Why Apple's Foldable iPhone May Be Smaller Than Expected</h3>\r<br/>\nApple's first foldable iPhone, rumored for release next year, may turn out to be smaller than most people imagine, if a recent report and new mockups are anything to go by.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-Fold-Vertical-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1265\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-988570\" />\r<br/>\nBased on <em>The Information</em>'s recent report that the foldable iPhone will feature a 5.3-inch external display and a 7.7-inch internal display when unfolded, designer Ben Geskin <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/23/foldable-iphone-small-outer-display/\">mocked up a physical representation of what such a device might look like in the hand</a>, and it's actually remarkably compact with a form factor very similar to a passport book.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is reportedly still <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/22/iphone-foldable-ultra-thin-glass-crease/\">testing next-generation ultra-thin flexible glass</a> for the device's interior display, seeking to find the best solution to make the crease down the middle essentially invisible.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Where's the New Apple TV?</h3>\r<br/>\nApple hasn't updated the Apple TV 4K since 2022, and 2025 was supposed to be the year that we got a refresh. There were rumors suggesting Apple would release the new ‌Apple TV‌ before the end of 2025, but it's clear that's not going to happen now.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/Apple-TV-Thumb-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030824\" />\r<br/>\nIt's not clear what happened, but it's possible Apple decided to hold all home-related product announcements until spring 2026, when the smarter, more capable version of Siri will be ready in iOS 26.4.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn the meantime, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/22/where-is-the-new-apple-tv/\">check out our video recapping what we might see in the next-generation Apple TV</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Turn Off the User Profiles Screen on Apple TV 4K</h3>\r<br/>\nSome current Apple TV users have been annoyed by the new profile selection screen that appears every time you wake the device. While it's a handy feature for multi-user households, there are plenty of households that want to use their Apple TVs under only a single profile, so the selection screen is simply a nuisance.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/tvOS-26-Profiles.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005305\" />\r<br/>\nFortunately, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/turn-off-user-profiles-screen-apple-tv/\">there's a relatively easy way to turn off the profile selection screen</a> if you know to look for it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>iOS 26.3 Brings AirPods-Like Pairing to Third-Party Devices in EU Under DMA</h3>\r<br/>\nApple is continuing to increase interoperability support in its products for users in the European Union due to the Digital Markets Act, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/22/ios-26-3-dma-airpods-pairing/\">EU is once again crediting the DMA for new expansions coming in iOS 26.3</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/iOS-26.3-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029939\" />\r<br/>\nThird-party devices like earbuds will be able to seamlessly pair with iOS devices similar to how AirPods and Beats products already work, by simply bringing the accessory close to the device to bring up a simple one-step pairing process.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUsers in the EU will also see expanded notifications support for third-party accessories like smartwatches, allowing users to view and interact with incoming iOS notifications on a third-party device as they can already do on an Apple Watch.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Hit With Supersized Fine in Italy Over an iPhone Privacy Feature</h3>\r<br/>\nItaly's Competition Authority (AGCM) has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/22/italy-fines-apple-over-app-tracking-transparency/\">imposed a €98.6 million (&#36;116 million) fine on Apple over its App Tracking Transparency feature</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/generic-tracking-prompt-orange.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1956\" height=\"1100\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030804\" />\r<br/>\nSince the release of iOS 14.5 in April 2021, Apple has required apps to ask for permission before tracking a user's activity across other apps and websites for personalized advertising, as part of a feature named App Tracking Transparency. If a user selects the \"Ask App Not to Track\" option, the app is unable to access the device's advertising identifier.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn a press release and executive summary this week, the AGCM said the App Tracking Transparency rules are \"disproportionate,\" and \"harmful\" to app developers and advertisers. Ultimately, it found that Apple abused its dominant position in the EU market.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>iPhone 18 Trial Production to Start in February Ahead of Spring 2027 Launch</h3>\r<br/>\nApple is reportedly already preparing to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/22/iphone-18-trial-production-begin-february/\">begin trial production of the iPhone 18 series after Chinese New Year</a>, according to Weibo-based leaker Fixed Focus Digital.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iphone-17-rear-camera.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1356\" height=\"764\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018135\" />\r<br/>\nThe claim suggests small-scale manufacturing runs will start once factories return to normal operations following the Lunar New Year shutdown, which typically ends in late February.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Chinese leaker claims that production lines for the iPhone 18 Pro models have already been set up, indicating that the Pro hardware design has already been locked in. Multiple sources have reported that Apple will move to a split-release strategy, with the Pro and Fold models debuting in the usual fall time frame while the standard iPhone 18 won't be released until spring 2027 alongside an iPhone 18e and potentially an iPhone Air 2.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>MacRumors Newsletter</h2>\r<br/>\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/dec-25-2025\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/27/top-stories-iphone-fold-mockup/\">Top Stories: iPhone Fold Mockup, Where&#039;s the New Apple TV?, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-iphone-fold-mockup-wheres-the-new-apple-tv-and-more.2475256/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> disclosed a roughly &#36;3 million open-market purchase of Nike shares this week (via <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/nike-climbs-apples-tim-cook-buys-3-million-stock-2025-12-24/\"><em>Reuters</em></a>).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Tim-Cook-WWDC-2024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-955202\" />\r<br/>\nAccording to a regulatory filing published yesterday, Cook purchased 50,000 Class B shares of Nike on December 22 at an average price of &#36;58.97 per share, for a total investment of approximately &#36;2.95 million. The filing shows that Cook now holds about 105,000 Nike shares, a position valued at nearly &#36;6 million.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNike shares rose following the disclosure, gaining between about 2% and 5% in premarket and early regular-session activity, after the stock had fallen sharply in the days following the company's most recent earnings report, which highlighted ongoing challenges in its business, particularly in China. Nike is currently in the early stages of a turnaround effort under CEO Elliott Hill, who returned to the company last year after retiring. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCook has served on Nike's board of directors since 2005 and is its lead independent director, a role he assumed in 2016 after Nike co-founder Phil Knight stepped down as chairman. In addition to his position at Apple, Cook also chairs Nike's compensation committee, placing him in a central governance role at the apparel maker. The December 22 transaction represents Cook's largest open-market purchase of Nike shares in years and comes at a time when the company is under pressure from investors following a prolonged decline in its stock price.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/24/tim-cook-buys-nike-shares/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook Buys &#36;3 Million of Nike Shares</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-buys-3-million-of-nike-shares.2475157/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

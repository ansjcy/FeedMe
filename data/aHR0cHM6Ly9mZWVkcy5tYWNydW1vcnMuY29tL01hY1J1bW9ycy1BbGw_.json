New subscribers will have access to lower prices for the first three months to a year, and a 10-day trial is available. Existing subscribers can downgrade to one of the more affordable plans.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Sports Plan</strong> - &#36;64.99 per month, or &#36;54.99 per month for new subscribers (1-year discount). Includes all major broadcasters (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox) plus sports networks like FS1, NBC Sports Network, all ESPN networks, and ESPN Unlimited.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Sports + News Plan</strong> - &#36;71.99 per month, or &#36;56.99 per month for new subscribers (3-month discount).

Add-ons like NFL Sunday Ticket, HBO Max, and 4K Plus can also be purchased. Plans are rolling out starting this week.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYouTube TV first launched in April 2017, and it was initially <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/04/05/youtube-tv-streaming-tv-service-launches/\">priced at &#36;35 per month</a>. It has more than doubled in price over the course of the last nine years. The last price increase came in December 2024, when YouTube raised the price from &#36;72.99 per month to &#36;82.99 per month.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYouTube TV is available across a wide range of devices, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube-tv/\">YouTube TV</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/09/youtube-tv-cheaper-bundles/\">YouTube TV Gets Cheaper Sports, News, and Entertainment Bundles</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/youtube-tv-gets-cheaper-sports-news-and-entertainment-bundles.2477443/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

OpenAI does not plan to show ads to minors, and the company claims that ads will not influence the answers that ChatGPT provides. OpenAI also says it will not provide advertisers with content from ChatGPT conversations.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOpenAI is not profitable, and the free and Go tier options require \"significant infrastructure and ongoing investment.\" OpenAI is funding that work through ads, and it says that customers who do not want to see ads can upgrade to a Plus or Pro plan. There's also an option to opt out of ads in exchange for fewer daily free messages.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAds in ChatGPT will be clearly labeled as sponsored and the information will be presented separately from answers that ChatGPT provides. By default, OpenAI will show ads based on conversation topic, past chats, and past interactions with ads. A conversation about recipes, for example, may surface ads for meal kits or grocery delivery.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAdvertisers will receive aggregate information like number of views or clicks, but won't have access to chat history, memories, or personal user information. Ads will not be shown for sensitive topics like health, mental health, or politics.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOpenAI is allowing users to dismiss ads, share feedback, and get information on why a particular ad is displayed. Ad data is also able to be deleted, and personalization can be disabled.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nChatGPT subscribers with Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Education plans will not see ads. OpenAI says the current rollout is a test to learn, listen, and get the ad experience right, and the company claims that it believes ads in ChatGPT can be \"uniquely valuable for people.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLast week, OpenAI competitor Anthropic promised to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/anthropic-clause-no-ads/\">keep the Claude chatbot ad-free</a> in response to OpenAI's plan to introduce ads. Anthropic shared an anti-ad commercial during the Super Bowl calling out OpenAI for its ad plans, and said that a \"conversation with Claude\" is not the right place for ads.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/\">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/09/chatgpt-now-has-ads/\">ChatGPT Now Has Ads for Free and Go Tier Users</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chatgpt-now-has-ads-for-free-and-go-tier-users.2477429/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Sometimes when you share a webpage link with someone, you just want to bring their attention to a specific passage or sentence to make your point, rather than have them read through the entire article.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/safari-icon-blue-banner.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-833485\" />\r<br/>\nIn 2020, Google added a function to its Chrome browser called Scroll to Text Fragment (STTF) that helps you achieve this. It allows URLs to link directly to any visible text on a page. You may have seen it work in Google Search, where clicking on a link in your returned results takes you to a highlighted passage of text further down the page.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGoogle later added the feature to the Chromium codebase, so most other popular Chromium browsers like Edge, Opera, Brave, and Vivaldi also support it. Here's how it works.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Copy Link With Highlight in Safari</h2>\r<br/>\nApple added full support for text fragment links in Safari 18, and the feature is available in Safari on macOS Sequoia and later. To use the feature, visit a web page and simply highlight the text you want to create a link to, then right-click (Ctrl-click) and choose <strong>Copy Link with Highlight</strong> from the dropdown menu.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/share-with-highlighted-text.jpg\" alt=\"safari\" width=\"2472\" height=\"808\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1035674\" /><div class=\"center-wrap\"><em>The \"Copy Link to Highlight\" option</em></div>\r<br/>\nThis will generate a special URL that includes a hash (#) symbol and \"text\" element, followed by a few words that bookend the selected text. All you need to do is share the link with someone, and when they click it they will be sent directly to that part of the webpage with the specific passage highlighted, as shown below.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/highlighted-text-shared-safari.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2463\" height=\"603\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1035670\" /><div class=\"center-wrap\"><em>The shared link as the recipient sees it</em></div>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThat's all there is to it. The Copy Link to Highlight option is also available in Safari on iPhone and iPad, though we have found it to be buggy and inconsistent in iOS 26.3. Hopefully Apple can fix it soon. At least on Mac, it makes it easier for you to direct the recipient of the link to the content you actually want them to focus on. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBear in mind that the look of highlighted text can differ depending on whether the page author has styled it to look a certain way. Also, text fragment linking does not work in PDFs. Since July 2025, Copy Link to Highlight has also been <a href=\"https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2025/07/28/copy-link-to-highlight-in-nightly-these-weeks-in-firefox-issue-185/\">introduced in Firefox</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/\">Safari</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/macos-share-weblink-jumps-to-specific-line/\">macOS: Share a Link That Jumps to a Specific Line on a Webpage</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-share-a-link-that-jumps-to-a-specific-line-on-a-webpage.2477421/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple's older MacBook Air with the M1 chip is now out of stock on Walmart's website in the U.S., amid rumors of a new lower-cost MacBook coming soon.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Multicolored-Low-Cost-A18-Pro-MacBook-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036750\" /><em>A colorful MacBook (concept)</em></div>\r<br/>\nWalmart first began selling the MacBook Air with the M1 chip <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/walmart-selling-macbook-air-with-m1-chip/\">for &#36;699 in March 2024</a>. The price later dropped to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/walmart-m1-macbook-air-for-649/\">&#36;649</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/macbook-air-with-m1-chip-599-at-walmart/\">then to &#36;599</a>, and briefly to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/25/walmart-selling-m1-macbook-air-for-549/\">as low as &#36;549</a> during a Black Friday sale last year. However, we just noticed that it has been out of stock <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/the-m1-macbook-air-is-missing-but-why?taid=69907569e03fbc000101899e\">for a while now</a>, and there is no indication if it will ever be returning.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple first released the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in November 2020, as one of the first Macs with an Apple silicon chip, instead of an Intel processor. The configuration being sold by Walmart for as low as &#36;549 included 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. They were new-in-box units, not refurbished or open-box models. Walmart's website continues to offer refurbished units from \"trusted sellers\" for as low as &#36;449.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-discontinues-m1-macbook-air/\">discontinued the MacBook Air with the M1 chip</a> in 2024, after it launched models with the M3 chip, and it has since updated the MacBook Air with the M4 chip. Prior to being discontinued, the model with the M1 chip was being sold for a starting price of &#36;999 brand new, but Amazon sometimes offered it on sale for &#36;749 to &#36;899.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe laptop going out of stock at Walmart could be a hint.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/\">plans to release a lower-priced MacBook</a> with a version of the iPhone 16 Pro's A18 Pro chip <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/low-cost-macbook-expected-on-march-4/\">as early as the first week of March</a>, according to several reports and leakers. This would be an all-new model positioned below the MacBook Air in the Mac lineup, and it would mark a revival of the \"MacBook\" brand (with no \"Air\" or \"Pro\" designation).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo was first to reveal that Apple is allegedly planning a more affordable MacBook. Last year, he said the laptop would have around a 13-inch display and come in fun colors, like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/low-cost-macbook-yellow-green-blue-pink/\">green, blue, pink, and/or yellow</a>. A few rumors have specifically said it will have a 12.9-inch screen.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe lower-cost MacBook could have a lot in common with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/09/apple-discontinues-12-inch-macbook/\">discontinued 12-inch MacBook</a>, including an ultra-thin and lightweight design. However, that model was powered by Intel processors. Apple stopped selling the 12-inch MacBook in July 2019, so there has been a long wait for a similar model powered by Apple silicon.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn the iPhone 16 Pro, the A18 Pro chip has a 6-core CPU and a 6-core GPU. The chip's multi-core performance is similar to the M1 chip, so this new MacBook could effectively be a replacement for the MacBook Air with the M1 chip, and that could explain why it is finally out of stock at Walmart ahead of the lower-cost MacBook launching.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/29/apple-responds-to-rising-memory-chip-prices/\">Skyrocketing DRAM and NAND storage chip prices</a> may have been a factor too, though.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith the A18 Pro chip, the lower-cost MacBook might have only 8GB of RAM, whereas all current MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models start with at least 16GB of RAM. The chip also lacks Thunderbolt support, so the new MacBook would likely be equipped with regular USB-C ports, with slower data transfer speeds and external display limitations.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-a18-pro/\">MacBook (A18 Pro)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/19/m1-macbook-air-out-of-stock-at-walmart/\">M1 MacBook Air Out of Stock at Walmart as Lower-Cost MacBook Nears</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m1-macbook-air-out-of-stock-at-walmart-as-lower-cost-macbook-nears.2477960/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

He goes over what it's been like using Apple's budget &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; over the past 12 months, and whether it's worth choosing over one of Apple's more expensive models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oaDbNoiJ0zI\" title=\"iPhone 1 Year Later Review — Still Worth It?

The other major feature that's missing is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>, which is majorly inconvenient since &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging is so prevalent. There's no Camera Control button, but that's easy to do without.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple used an older design for the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, so it still has a tired-looking notch instead of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a>, and it only comes in black or white so there are no fun colors to choose from. Other than the camera, design, and &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; shortcomings, the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is remarkably similar to Apple's other iPhones and you're not going to notice much in the way of day-to-day differences between the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; and a higher-end model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe definitely don't recommend buying an &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; right now, but the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e that's going to launch very soon will absolutely be worth considering over Apple's more expensive flagship iPhones.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is going to solve some of the problems that we had with the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;. It could get a &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; for the first time, adding all of the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; features like Live Activities, and it's supposedly going to be updated with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;. We're also expecting Apple's upgraded C1X modem and the same A19 chip that's in the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs long as you don't mind the lack of extra cameras, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e, like the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, is going to be a very competitive &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that gives you a lot of performance for the money. If you've been waiting to upgrade from an older device, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e has the potential to be a very good buy.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/19/iphone-16e-long-term-review/\">iPhone 16e Long-Term Review: What to Know Before the iPhone 17e Launches</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16e-long-term-review-what-to-know-before-the-iphone-17e-launches.2477945/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "West Virginia's Attorney General JB McCuskey today announced a lawsuit against Apple, accusing the company of knowingly allowing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> to be used to distribute and store child sexual abuse material (CSAM). McCuskey says that Apple has opted to \"do nothing about it\" for years.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/iCloud-General-Feature-Redux.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-982796\" />\r<br/>\n<blockquote>\"Preserving the privacy of child predators is absolutely inexcusable. And more importantly, it violates West Virginia law. Since Apple has so far refused to police themselves and do the morally right thing, I am filing this lawsuit to demand Apple follow the law, report these images, and stop re-victimizing children by allowing these images to be stored and shared,\" Attorney General JB McCuskey said.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nAccording to the lawsuit [<a href=\"https://ago.wv.gov/sites/default/files/2026-02/Filing.pdf\">PDF</a>], Apple has described itself as the \"greatest platform for distributing child porn\" internally, but it submits far fewer reports about CSAM than peers like Google and Meta.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBack in 2021, Apple announced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/apple-new-child-safety-features/\">new child safety features</a>, including a system that would detect known CSAM in images stored in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-photo-library/\">iCloud Photos</a>. After backlash from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/13/apple-employees-concerns-over-csam/\">customers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/06/snowden-eff-slam-plan-to-scan-messages-images/\">digital rights groups</a>, child safety advocates, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/security-researchers-alarmed-apple-csam-plans/\">security researchers</a>, Apple decided to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/07/apple-abandons-icloud-csam-detection/\">abandon its plans</a> for CSAM detection in &zwnj;iCloud Photos&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"Children can be protected without companies combing through personal data, and we will continue working with governments, child advocates, and other companies to help protect young people, preserve their right to privacy, and make the internet a safer place for children and for us all,\" Apple said when announcing that it would not implement the feature.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/01/apple-explains-csam-plan-abandoned/\">later explained</a> that creating a tool for scanning private &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; data would \"create new threat vectors for data thieves to find and exploit.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWest Virginia's Attorney General says that Apple has shirked its responsibility to protect children under the guise of user privacy, and that Apple's decision not to deploy detection technology is a choice, not passive oversight. The lawsuit suggests that since Apple has end-to-end control over hardware, software, and cloud infrastructure, it is not able to claim to be an \"unknowing, passive conduit of CSAM.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe lawsuit is seeking punitive damages and injunctive relief requiring Apple to implement effective CSAM detection measures.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple was also sued in 2024 over its decision to abandon CSAM detection. A lawsuit representing a potential group of 2,680 victims said that Apple's failure to implement CSAM monitoring tools has caused ongoing harm to victims. That lawsuit is seeking &#36;1.2 billion.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">Apple Lawsuits</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/19/apple-west-virginia-csam-lawsuit/\">Apple Sued by West Virginia for Allegedly Allowing CSAM Distribution Through iCloud</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-sued-by-west-virginia-for-allegedly-allowing-csam-distribution-through-icloud.2477946/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

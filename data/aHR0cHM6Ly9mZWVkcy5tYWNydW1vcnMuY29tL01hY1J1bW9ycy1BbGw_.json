Apple is implementing a new voice control screen that will let apps provide visual feedback for voice-based conversational apps.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAI apps that integrate &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; will need to add support for the voice control screen while voice-based services are active. There is a specific entitlement for voice-based conversational apps, and companies that make chatbots will need to update their apps to add &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; support.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; has long supported third-party apps, but Apple limits the kinds of apps that are available to ensure drivers aren't distracted while in their vehicles. Companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google were not able to create &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; apps before now, limiting &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; users to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> voice controls while in the vehicle.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe new integration will let &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; users access voice-based apps like ChatGPT to ask questions hands-free, but the apps will not be able to control vehicle or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> functions. There also won't be a wake word option to activate a third-party app, so users will still need to open the app to use the chatbot. After an app is launched, the customizable voice control screen will give users vehicle-optimized chatbot experiences.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\niOS 26.4 is in beta right now, and it is expected to see a release this spring.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/ios-26-4-carplay-support/\">iOS 26.4 Brings CarPlay Support for ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-4-brings-carplay-support-for-chatgpt-claude-and-gemini.2477903/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Back at WWDC 2025, Apple revealed that it was planning to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/carplay-airplay-video-in-the-car/\">allow CarPlay users to watch video via AirPlay</a> in their vehicles while they are not driving, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/ios-26-4-public-beta-1/\">first beta of iOS 26.4</a> suggests the feature may be nearing availability.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/CarPlay-Liquid-Glass-Dark.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005143\" />\r<br/>\nThere are several new references to CarPlay video streaming functionality within the iOS 26.4 beta's source code. The feature is not yet visible to users, but software developer <a href=\"https://thomasdye.net/thomas-dye\">Thomas Dye</a> managed to get it working to some extent in Xcode's CarPlay simulator on the Mac, and he showed it off in a recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WPjCuTKEHE\">YouTube video</a> (<a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/18/early-demo-reveals-how-carplay-handles-video-in-ios-26-4-including-apple-tv-ui/\">via <em>9to5Mac</em></a>).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7WPjCuTKEHE?si=-IKjxCi0MhmBxi8h\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r<br/>\nOn an iPhone connected to CarPlay, it appears that videos in any AirPlay-supported app can be played on the car's display. In the Dynamic Island, there is a button that allows you to show the video on the iPhone instead, when you want to.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe demo also reveals that an Apple TV app will be available on CarPlay, allowing you to access shows and movies from the Apple TV streaming service and your own library. There is also a tab for accessing MLS Season Pass. However, it is not entirely clear if the Apple TV app will actually be this fully featured on the real version of CarPlay.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe simulator provides an early albeit fairly clunky look at CarPlay's video streaming in action. The feature will likely be available by time iOS 26.4 is released to the general public in late March or early April, but there is a chance it will get held back until iOS 26.5 or later if Apple needs more time to wrap up development.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's website <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/carplay/\">indicates</a> that automakers will need to implement support for the CarPlay video functionality, due to the safety requirement that the vehicle be parked, so it may take some time for the feature to widely roll out.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<strong>Related Reading:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/ios-26-4-new-iphone-features/\">iOS 26.4 Adds These 12 New Features to Your iPhone</a><div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/ios-26-4-major-new-carplay-feature-revealed/\">iOS 26.4&#039;s New CarPlay Video Feature Shown in Action</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-4s-new-carplay-video-feature-shown-in-action.2477900/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "New trade-in data indicates that Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a> Max has rapidly become the single most traded-in smartphone.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iphone-17-pro-green.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1020285\" />\r<br/>\nAccording to a new report from <a href=\"https://www.sellcell.com/blog/iphone-17-pro-max-most-traded-in-phone/\">SellCell</a>, Apple's latest flagship <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> has quickly risen to the top of the independent trade-in market, accounting for 11.5% of all devices appearing in the top-20 trade-in rankings just months after release. The analysis is based on SellCell internal trade-in data and secondary market pricing trends gathered from 40 independent &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; buyers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max's share of the top-20 trade-in rankings increased from about 5.1% in late November to 11.5% by early February, more than doubling in approximately 12 weeks. 86% of traded-in units were categorized as being in mint or good condition, suggesting many owners are selling soon after purchase.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 15 Pro Max and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 Pro Max remain prominent, each accounting for approximately 7.3% of trade-ins, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> Pro Max and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 sit at 7.2% of trade-ins each. The top-20 devices collectively represent around 47% of all trade-in activity.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTrade-in rankings typically reflect a wide mix of devices at different points in their lifecycle, with older models often dominating resale volume due to large installed bases and the natural upgrade cycle. The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max's rapid rise is therefore notable because the device only entered the market relatively recently yet has already become the most frequently traded-in model across the tracked channels.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max has apparently lost approximately 25.4% of its value since launch when measuring average resale prices for mint-condition devices over a 145-day period. Over an equivalent timeframe, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro Max lost roughly 32.5% of its value. This represents more than 7% lower depreciation for the newer model and translates to as much as &#36;95 in additional retained value compared with the previous generation over the same period. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSellCell attributes early trade-ins primarily to strong resale pricing. Average resale values for mint-condition &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max devices currently sit around &#36;967.50. Premium smartphones can function as short-term assets that owners may sell to release cash when needed, so the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max's rise to the top of trade-ins likely reflects broader economic conditions.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sellcell/\">SellCell</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-17-Pro\">iPhone 17 Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/iphone-17-pro-max-becomes-most-traded-in-phone/\">iPhone 17 Pro Max Curiously Becomes Most Traded-In Smartphone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-max-curiously-becomes-most-traded-in-smartphone.2477898/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The invite graphic shows a 3D Apple logo made up of transparent discs in yellow, green, and blue. The post effectively constitutes a claim that the device is set to arrive at the event.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Apple-Announces-Special-Event-in-New-York-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2196\" height=\"1235\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1036438\" />\r<br/>\nIn June 2025, analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/\">said</a> that the more-affordable MacBook could come in silver, blue, pink, and yellow finishes, which would match the entry-level <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>. In his <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/low-cost-macbook-yellow-green-blue-pink/\">latest newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple has tested a range of playful color options for its upcoming low-cost MacBook, going well beyond the muted tones available on its current laptop lineup.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGurman said the colors tested so far include light yellow, light green, blue, pink, classic silver, and dark gray, although he added that it is unlikely all of them will ship. The color palette would make the budget MacBook the most colorful laptop Apple has offered since the iBook G3 era in the late 90s, which included Tangerine, Blueberry, Indigo, Graphite, and Key Lime.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe low-cost machine is expected to feature a 12.9-inch display, an aluminum chassis, and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> chip, likely the A18 Pro, rather than an M-series processor.

The filing shows that Cook now holds about 105,000 Nike shares, a position valued at nearly &#36;6 million.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNike shares rose following the disclosure, gaining between about 2% and 5% in premarket and early regular-session activity, after the stock had fallen sharply in the days following the company's most recent earnings report, which highlighted ongoing challenges in its business, particularly in China. Nike is currently in the early stages of a turnaround effort under CEO Elliott Hill, who returned to the company last year after retiring. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCook has served on Nike's board of directors since 2005 and is its lead independent director, a role he assumed in 2016 after Nike co-founder Phil Knight stepped down as chairman. In addition to his position at Apple, Cook also chairs Nike's compensation committee, placing him in a central governance role at the apparel maker. The December 22 transaction represents Cook's largest open-market purchase of Nike shares in years and comes at a time when the company is under pressure from investors following a prolonged decline in its stock price.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/24/tim-cook-buys-nike-shares/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook Buys &#36;3 Million of Nike Shares</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-buys-3-million-of-nike-shares.2475157/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Brazilian regulators have approved a settlement that will require Apple to change how the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> operates on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> in the country, including allowing alternative app stores, expanded payment options, and a defined new fee structure.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Clorange.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-833988\" />\r<br/>\nIn a <a href=\"https://www.gov.br/cade/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/cade-forma-maioria-pela-homologacao-de-tcc-em-investigacao-sobre-praticas-da-apple-no-ios\">press release</a>, Brazil's Administrative Council of Economic Defense (CADE), said its court has approved a Term of Commitment to Cease proposed by Apple to resolve an investigation into the company's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules on iOS. The case began in 2022 and examined whether Apple's restrictions on app distribution and payments limited competition in Brazil.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCADE said the investigation focused on Apple's prohibition of third-party app stores on iOS, the requirement that developers use Apple's in-app purchase system for digital goods and subscriptions, and restrictions that prevented developers from informing users about alternative payment options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUnder the settlement, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/23/ios-alternative-app-stores-brazil/\">will be required</a> to allow developers in Brazil to link to external payment options and promote offers that take place outside their apps. Developers will also be permitted to offer third-party payment methods within their apps alongside Apple's own in-app purchase system, with CADE requiring that these options be presented next to Apple's payment option.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple will also have to allow third-party app stores in Brazil. CADE specified that Apple may still display warnings or informational messages to users, but those messages must be neutral, objective, and limited in scope, and must not introduce extra steps or barriers that make alternative options harder to use. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAccording to Brazilian technology site <em><a href=\"https://tecnoblog.net/noticias/apple-ainda-podera-cobrar-taxas-no-brasil-veja-aliquotas/\">Tecnoblog</a></em>, which said it obtained the details directly from CADE, purchases made through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; will remain subject to a 10% or 25% commission under standard terms. Developers who use Apple's payment system would also pay a 5% transaction fee.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf an app directs users to pay outside the app using only static text, with no clickable link or button, Apple will not charge a fee. If the app includes a clickable button or link that sends users to an external website for payment, Apple will charge a 15% fee. Third-party app stores will be subject to a 5% Core Technology Commission.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCADE said Apple will have up to 105 days to implement the required changes once the new rules become binding. <div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/brazil/\">Brazil</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/24/new-app-store-fee-structure-in-brazil/\">Apple to Introduce New App Store Fee Structure in Brazil Following Antitrust Settlement</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-introduce-new-app-store-fee-structure-in-brazil-following-antitrust-settlement.2475156/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

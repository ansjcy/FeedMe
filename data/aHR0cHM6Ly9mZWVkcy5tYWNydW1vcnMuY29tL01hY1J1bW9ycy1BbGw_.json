      "content": "Back in late 2022 and early 2023, Apple rolled out a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/25/home-app-architecture-update-ios-16-2/\">new architecture for its Apple Home platform</a> to deliver improved performance and compatibility, although the rollout came with some hiccups that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/21/apple-pulls-new-home-architecture/\">forced Apple to pull</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/apple-makes-new-home-upgrade-available/\">later re-release the upgrade</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/apple-homekit-ios-18-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1220\" height=\"686\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001345\" />\r<br/>\nThree years later, Apple is now on the verge of ending support for the old version of the Home architecture, which may result in access to the entire Home platform being blocked for some users if they do not or cannot update. The deadline for updating was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-ending-support-old-homekit-architecture/\">originally announced as fall 2025</a>, but in early November, Apple announced that it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/03/apple-delays-home-app-update-requirement/\">pushing back the deadline to February 10, 2026</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt appears Apple will be sticking with that deadline, as the company is sending out fresh reminder emails today to users who have yet to upgrade to the new version of Apple Home.<blockquote>This email serves as your second reminder that support for the earlier version of Apple Home will <strong>end next month</strong> on <strong>February 10, 2026</strong>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf you do not update to this new version of Apple Home, your access to your home within the Home app might be blocked, accessories and automations might not work as expected, and you will not receive important security fixes and performance improvements. Updating to the new version of Apple Home can also enable new features, such as guest access, support for robot vacuum cleaners, Activity History, and more.</blockquote>Users can update to the new version of Apple Home within the Software Update section of Home Settings in the Home app. If you have already completed these steps, or \"This home and all accessories are up to date\" is shown in Software Update, then you are already on the current version and there is nothing more you need to do.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNotably, the new version of Apple Home <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/102287\">requires a minimum of iOS 16.2, iPadOS 16.2, macOS 13.1, tvOS 16.2, and watchOS 9.2</a>, and older devices that have not been or cannot be updated will lose access to the Apple Home after updating. This requirement has not sat well with some users who may use older devices as dedicated Home control devices, so many of these users have put off upgrading their Home architecture for as long as possible, but it now appears the reprieve is coming to an end.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home/\">Home</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/09/apple-home-app-upgrade-reminder/\">Apple Reminding Users of Pending Home App Upgrade Requirement</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reminding-users-of-pending-home-app-upgrade-requirement.2475820/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

In response, X appears to have scaled back the ability for Grok to generate images in response to X posts by non-paying users, but <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/859309/grok-undressing-limit-access-gaslighting\"><em>The Verge</em> notes</a> that the tools remain available to paying subscribers and through the dedicated Grok tab in the X and in the standalone Grok app.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe senators argue that the \"harmful and likely illegal depictions\" are in violation of Apple's and Google's app store terms and that the two companies must remove the apps until the policy violations are addressed.<blockquote>. . . Apple's terms of service bar apps from including \"offensive\" or \"just plain creepy\" content, which under any definition must include nonconsensually-generated sexualized images of children and women. Further, Apple's terms explicitly bar apps from including content that is \"[o]vertly sexual or pornographic material\" including material \"intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTurning a blind eye to X's egregious behavior would make a mockery of your moderation practices. Indeed, not taking action would undermine your claims in public and in court that your app stores offer a safer user experience than letting users download apps directly to their phones. This principle has been core to your advocacy against legislative reforms to increase app store competition and your defenses to claims that your app stores abuse their market power through their payment systems.</blockquote>The senators request a written response to their letter by January 23.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/grok/\">Grok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/09/senators-apple-google-remove-grok/\">U.S. Senators Ask Apple and Google to Remove X and Grok Apps Over Sexualized Image Generation</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/u-s-senators-ask-apple-and-google-to-remove-x-and-grok-apps-over-sexualized-image-generation.2475818/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple this week secured another victory in its ongoing legal dispute with heart monitoring company AliveCor, after a federal appeals court upheld a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-wins-alivecor-antitrust-fight/\">2024 ruling</a> that found Apple's changes to the Apple Watch were lawful product improvements rather than anticompetitive behavior.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/03/Kardia-Band-apple-watch.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-493409\" />\r<br/>\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court decision that rejected AliveCor's antitrust claims. AliveCor had argued that Apple illegally monopolized the market for heart rate analysis apps on watchOS when it replaced its Heart Rate during Physical Observation (HRPO) algorithm with its heart rate neural network (HRNN) algorithm in watchOS 5. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAliveCor claimed that Apple changed the algorithm so that its ECG KardiaBand could no longer identify irregular heart rhythms – as part of an alleged effort to \"eliminate opposition\" in the heart rate analysis space – and requested that it reinstate the old algorithm.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple argued that AliveCor did not have the right to dictate Apple's design decisions, and that the request to support the older heart rate technology would require the court to be a day-to-day enforcer of how Apple engineers its products. The court ultimately agreed with Apple.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Ninth Circuit has now affirmed Apple's victory. \"The undisputed evidence shows as a matter of law that Apple's refusal to share HRPO data was not anticompetitive,\" <a href=\"https://content.mlex.com/Attachments/2024-02-13_96R1Q69F5VP38H27/Alivecor%20v%20Apple%20order.pdf\">the court wrote</a>. It added that even if some form of heart rate data access were essential for competing in the market, AliveCor's claim would still fail because Apple provides app developers with access to the same Tachogram API data that Apple's Irregular Rhythm Notification feature uses.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe appeals court also rejected AliveCor's argument that Apple had a duty to share its proprietary data with competitors. The ruling said that antitrust laws generally impose no obligation for companies to deal with their rivals. It also noted that such a requirement \"would implicate the same concerns regarding incentives to innovate and judicial competency that the Supreme Court has articulated.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe decision is Apple's second major win against AliveCor within the last year. In March, the Federal Circuit <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-alivecor-itc-win/\">confirmed</a> the invalidation of three AliveCor patents related to heart rate monitoring, vacating an International Trade Commission ruling that could have led to an Apple Watch import ban.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAliveCor said at the time of the court's original ruling that it was \"deeply disappointed\" by the decision and would continue to explore all available legal options, including potential appeals.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/alivecor/\">AliveCor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">Apple Lawsuits</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/09/apple-wins-another-victory-alivecor-legal-battle/\">Apple Wins Another Round in AliveCor Legal Battle Over Heart Rate Tech</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wins-another-round-in-alivecor-legal-battle-over-heart-rate-tech.2475815/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "2026 could be a bumper year for Apple's Mac lineup, with the company expected to announce as many as four separate MacBook launches. Rumors suggest Apple will court both ends of the consumer spectrum, with more affordable options for students and feature-rich premium lines for users that seek the highest specifications from a laptop.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/Touchscreen-MacBook-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023744\" />\r<br/>\nBelow is a breakdown of what we're expecting over the next 12 months from Apple's multi-pronged MacBook offering. Got your eye on a particular model? Let us know in the comments what you're looking forward to most.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Low-Cost MacBook</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/Low-Cost-MacBook-Feature-A18-Pro.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2680\" height=\"1508\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1008940\" />\r<br/>\nApple is preparing to enter the low-cost laptop market for the first time by developing a budget MacBook aimed at luring away customers from Chromebooks and entry-level Windows PCs, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-04/apple-readies-a-low-cost-laptop-to-rival-chromebooks-and-windows-pcs\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. The new device is said to be designed for students, businesses, and casual users, and will target people who mainly browse the web, work on documents, or dabble in light media editing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe new MacBook is said to have a 13-inch display, similar to but slightly smaller than the MacBook Air, and will feature an ultra-thin, lightweight design with a lower-end LCD display. According to reputable industry analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, Apple is said to be using its A18 Pro chip to power the machine. The A18 Pro chip debuted in the iPhone 16 Pro and is around 40% slower than Apple's latest M4 chip, but its multi-core CPU performance is virtually identical to the M1 chip in the 2020 MacBook Air, and it even outperforms the M1 chip for graphics.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A18 Pro chip lacks Thunderbolt support, so the new MacBook would likely be equipped with regular USB-C ports. The current 13-inch MacBook Air starts at &#36;999 in the U.S., so the new MacBook would likely have a starting price of between &#36;699 and &#36;899. The more-affordable MacBook could also come in some fun new colors like Silver, Blue, Pink, and Yellow.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>MacBook Pro With M5 Pro and M5 Max</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/M5-MacBook-Pro.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023242\" />\r<br/>\nApple is going to refresh the rest of the MacBook Pro lineup with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips in early 2026, having already updated its base 14-inch MacBook Pro with a standard M5 chip in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-announces-macbook-pro-with-m5-chip/\">October</a>. The M5 series is based on TSMC's third-generation 3-nanometer technology. Based on improvements to the base MacBook Pro with M5 chip, faster SSD performance and higher memory bandwith are also likely for the high-end models. No other major changes are expected, with Apple holding over a completely refreshed design until the M6 models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf Apple retains current pricing levels, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M5 Pro chip will start at &#36;1,999, while the 16-inch model with M5 Pro chip will start at &#36;2,399. For the M5 Max equivalents, prices could start at &#36;3,199 for the 14-inch model, and &#36;3,499 for the 16-inch machine. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>M5 MacBook Air</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/macbook-air-blue.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-985851\" />\r<br/>\nWhile the M4 MacBook Air model isn't exactly old, attention is already turning to its successor. The M5 series is reportedly being manufactured using TSMC's advanced 3-nanometer process technology, and we have some idea of what to expect in terms of performance, thanks to the recently released M5 iPad Pro: <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/14173685\">benchmarks</a> show single-core scores around 4,133 and multi-core scores around 15,437. That's roughly a 12-15% jump over the M4 iPad Pro in both categories. As for graphics performance, the M5 chip appears to have up to a 36% faster GPU compared to the M4 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe benchmark suggests Apple has focused on modest clock speed increases and core-level efficiency improvements for the M5 chip, rather than an architecture overhaul. In other words, the M5 will be similar to the step-wise performance upgrade from M3 to M4. Expect 10-15% faster CPU speeds, a slightly more powerful GPU, and better efficiency, potentially leading to even longer battery life.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-14/apple-pitches-a-return-to-design-roots-six-years-after-jony-ive-exit-2026-plan\">reports</a> that Apple plans to roll out M5 versions of the MacBook Air in the first quarter of this year. Based on previous spring refreshes, this suggests a likely March 2026 window. As for pricing, we expect it to remain stable, with the base model sticking with the current entry-level &#36;999 price.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>MacBook Pro With Touchscreen OLED Display</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/M6-MacBook-Pro-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1265\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-984552\" />\r<br/>\nApple is reportedly developing a completely new version of the MacBook Pro packed with next-generation hardware features. The redesigned models are expected to boast M6 chips, which could adopt a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/iphone-18-enhanced-2nm-chip-12gb-ram/\">completely new packaging</a> based on TSMC's 2nm process that allows components such as the CPU, GPUs, DRAM, and Neural Engine to be more tightly integrated.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman says Apple is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-16/apple-readies-high-end-macbook-pro-with-touch-hole-punch-screen\">readying OLED technology</a> for these models. Compared to current MacBook Pro models that use mini-LED screens, the benefits of OLED technology would include increased brightness, higher contrast ratio with deeper blacks, improved power efficiency for longer battery life, and more. In addition, Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-plans-thinner-iphone-slimmer-macbook/\">reports</a> that the new machines will also have \"thinner and lighter frames.\" Apple is apparently focusing on delivering the thinnest possible device without compromising on battery life or major new features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are also expected to have a hole-punch camera at the top of the display, rather than the notch we've become accustomed to. Gurman says that the design \"leaves a display area around the sensor... similar in concept to the Dynamic Island on the iPhone.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's first OLED MacBook Pro will also feature a touchscreen display, according to analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/17/kuo-2026-oled-macbook-pro-touch-panel/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. The claim has since been <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-16/apple-readies-high-end-macbook-pro-with-touch-hole-punch-screen\">corroborated</a> by Gurman, noting that the touchscreen MacBook Pro will retain a full trackpad and keyboard.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nResearch firm <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/oled-macbook-pro-could-launch-as-soon-as-2026/\">Omdia</a> says Apple is \"highly likely\" to introduce new MacBook Pros featuring OLED displays this year, while Gurman has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-16/apple-readies-high-end-macbook-pro-with-touch-hole-punch-screen\">said</a> the new OLED machines are being readied for late 2026 or early 2027. It would be unusual for Apple to introduce two ‌MacBook Pro‌ refreshes in the same year, but there is precedent for it: Apple updated the MacBook Pro lineup twice in 2023, first with M2 Pro/M2 Max chips in January and then with M3/M3 Pro/M3 Max chips in late October.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDue to the pricier components, the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros are expected to cost a few hundred dollars more than current versions. Today's models with high-end chips start at &#36;1,999 for the 14-inch version and &#36;2,499 for the 16-inch one.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">MacBook Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/09/apple-launch-four-macbooks-2026/\">Apple Is Expected to Launch These Four MacBooks in 2026</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-is-expected-to-launch-these-four-macbooks-in-2026.2475814/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Spam and cold calls have become such a nuisance that many people simply don't answer their phone unless they recognize the number. In iOS 26, though, you can learn about who's calling before you respond, thanks to a clever feature that intercepts unknown calls and asks the caller to identify themselves before your iPhone even rings.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iOS-26-Phone-App-Features.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012692\" />\r<br/>\nThe \"Ask Reason for Calling\" feature is kind of like having your own receptionist. When someone who isn't in your Contacts calls, your iPhone automatically answers the call with a polite automated message asking for their name and reason for calling. The caller is placed on hold while their response is transcribed to text and displayed on your screen, letting you decide whether to accept, decline, or ask for more information.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt's a decent upgrade from the existing \"Silence Unknown Callers\" option, which simply sends all unrecognized numbers straight to voicemail. With the new approach, legitimate callers – like your doctor or a delivery service – can identify themselves, whereas robocallers and spammers are likely to hang up when greeted by the automated response.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>How to Enable Ask Reason for Calling</h2>\r<br/>\nThe following steps show you how to turn on the feature:\r<br/>\n<ol>\r<br/>\n<li>Open Settings on your iPhone.</li>\r<br/>\n<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Apps</strong>.</li>\r<br/>\n<li>Select <strong>Phone</strong>.</li>\r<br/>\n<li>Under the \"Screen Unknown Callers\" section, tap <strong>Ask Reason for Calling</strong>.</li>\r<br/>\n</ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/iphone-ask-calling-before-pickup.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"4170\" height=\"2760\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022169\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThat's all there is to it. Your iPhone will now intercept calls from numbers not saved in your Contacts and request information before alerting you.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Other Unknown Caller Screening Options</h2>\r<br/>\nIf you don't want to use the new Ask Reason for Calling feature, iOS 26 offers two alternative approaches for handling unknown numbers:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<ul><li><strong>Silence</strong>: This option automatically sends all calls from unsaved numbers to voicemail. The calls still appear in your Recents list, and you'll receive the voicemail if the caller leaves one. It's the same behavior as the \"Silence Unknown Callers\" toggle in iOS 18.</li>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<li><strong>Never</strong>: With this setting, calls from unknown numbers ring normally, just like calls from saved contacts. Missed calls appear in your Recents list as usual. It's your typical iPhone calling experience.</li></ul>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTo switch between these options, go to <strong>Settings ➝ Apps ➝ Phone</strong>, and select your preferred option under \"Screen Unknown Callers.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Ask Reason for Calling feature works best when you maintain an up-to-date Contacts list. Any number saved in Contacts will ring through normally without triggering the screening process, so make sure to add the details of legitimate contacts as soon as you know them.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-iphone-ask-callers-before-answer/\">Get Your iPhone to Ask Callers Who They Are Before You Answer</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/get-your-iphone-to-ask-callers-who-they-are-before-you-answer.2475801/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

It is able to be activated alongside other &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; and Matter devices using automations in the Apple Home app.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUsers can set up temporary access codes for guests, track entry history, and get alerts if someone attempts to use an invalid code. The lock incorporates the Kwikset SmartKey Security, so it can be rekeyed in seconds. The lock is available in satin nickel and black color options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUnlike some of the higher-end smart locks that have been coming out at CES, the Aura Reach does not include UWB, nor does it work with Apple's Home Key feature.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Aura Reach is one of several Matter-enabled smart locks in Kwikset's lineup, including the Halo Select and Halo Select Plus. Compared to those locks, it lacks Wi-Fi, Home Key, and door sensing technology that's able to determine whether a door is open or closed.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Aura Reach is priced at &#36;189 and is available from major retailers <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKwikset-Bluetooth-Deadbolt-Proximity-Auto-Unlock%2Fdp%2FB0G2YXDJNR%2F\">like Amazon</a> starting today.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2026/\">CES 2026</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/05/kwikset-aura-reach-lock/\">CES 2026: Kwikset Launches &#36;189 Aura Reach Smart Lock With Matter Integration</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2026-kwikset-launches-189-aura-reach-smart-lock-with-matter-integration.2475630/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Samsung says the monitor uses real-time eye tracking to adjust depth and perspective in response to the viewer's position, providing a layered sense of dimension with no need for a headset.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Odyssey G9 features a 165Hz refresh rate that's enhanced to 330Hz with Dual Mode, and 1ms gray-to-gray response time for minimal motion blur and ghosting. Samsung says that PC gamers will have access to an expanded lineup of supported titles with 3D effects created in collaboration with game studios, so it's unclear if the 3D functionality will be available for Macs.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEither way, games will not natively support 3D functionality, and game designers will need to optimize their games for the technology. The first games that will offer support include The First Berserker: Khazan, Lies of P: Overture, and Stellar Blade. According to Samsung, gamers can expect added dimensionality that enhances terrain, distance, and object separation compared to standard 2D gameplay.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSamsung's 27-inch Odyssey G6 display offers a 600Hz refresh rate enhanced to 1,040Hz through Dual Mode for competitive gaming. Players will be able to better track targets and see fine details during high-speed movement. The G6 is compatible with AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are also several new Odyssey G8 displays, including a 32-inch 6K model with a 165Hz refresh rate, a 27-inch 5K model with a 180Hz refresh rate, and a 32-inch OLED model with a 240Hz refresh rate.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMore information on Samsung's Odyssey display lineup can be <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-unveils-new-odyssey-gaming-monitor-lineup-world-first-6k-3d-ultra-high-resolution-displays/\">found on the Samsung website</a>.

It also includes a USB-C port capable of supplying up to 15W of power to a second device. It is concealed beneath the base of the tray to reduce visible cables. The Valet is powered via a USB-C port with a braided cable.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe tray is built around a weighted zinc alloy base for stability and is wrapped in Nappa leather. The charging pad itself is raised slightly above the tray surface, creating a defined area for phone placement while leaving the surrounding space available for other personal items.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nValet is available with black or taupe leather as standard, while the outer metal frame is removable and can be swapped independently of the main body, with options for black, taupe, brown, or ecru inserts. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere is an integrated cable management system in the base, enabling the Valet to be oriented in four different configurations. This allows the wireless charging pad to be positioned on the left or right side of the tray, or the entire unit to be rotated into a portrait orientation for narrower surfaces. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA small status light provides visual confirmation that a device has begun charging. The light briefly pulses when charging starts and then fades out after eight seconds.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nValet is <a href=\"https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/valet?srsltid=AfmBOop53cua8LDK4UYj7S66mBz0oi9-nsiCYegqvrs26TVDeH5Ae0SJ\">available for pre-order</a> in the United States  for &#36;179.99, with launch scheduled for January 15, 2026.

Previously, these devices were limited to 80MHz.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn ideal conditions, a 160MHz maximum means that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> and Mac users should see faster file transfers, quicker uploads, and smoother streaming. Wi-Fi 6E devices can take advantage of 6GHz networks, but 5GHz networks remain far more common. 6GHz networks require new router hardware, along with a machine that can take advantage of a 6GHz network.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith the upgrade, Wi-Fi 6E devices that connect to a 5GHz network can get throughput approaching peak 6GHz speeds without having to connect to a 6GHz network. Users who have a Wi-Fi 6 or 6E setup that supports 160MHz on 5GHz networks will be able to take advantage of the bandwidth improvement. Macs that have the updated 160MHz bandwidth limit will not see improvements when connected to 5GHz routers limited to 80MHz.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThough 5GHz bandwidth has improved on select Macs and iPads, 6GHz networks still have the benefit of less congestion and more spectrum.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<em>(Thanks, Johnie!)</em><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/05/wifi-6e-macs-ipads-bandwidth-increase/\">iPadOS and macOS 26.2 Double 5GHz Wi-Fi Bandwidth for Wi-Fi 6E Devices</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-and-macos-26-2-double-5ghz-wi-fi-bandwidth-for-wi-fi-6e-devices.2475624/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

In vehicles, however, Dolby Atmos playback through Apple &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; has depended on automakers integrating compatible audio hardware, resulting in availability being restricted to a relatively small number of high-end models. Pioneer's new SPHERA in-dash receiver makes Atmos-capable &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; available to a much broader base of drivers through aftermarket installation.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe system uses a vehicle's existing speaker setup rather than requiring specialized or factory-installed Atmos hardware. The company says the receiver uses an optimized four-channel configuration that works with standard front and rear speakers, allowing spatial audio playback without additional height or ceiling-mounted speakers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPioneer's proprietary Pure Autotuning technology is designed to address the acoustic variability of vehicle interiors, accounting for different sizes, shapes, materials, and speaker placements. It automatically adjusts time alignment, frequency response, and channel levels to place the listener at what Pioneer calls the acoustic center position. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe receiver itself features a 10.1-inch HD capacitive touchscreen and supports wireless &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, wireless Android Auto, and Bluetooth connectivity. The interface includes a split-screen mode that allows navigation to remain visible while drivers access audio controls or system functions. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSPHERA is designed for universal aftermarket installation and can be fitted to a wide variety of vehicles with minimal modification. Pioneer announced it at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2026/\">CES 2026</a> and said the receiver will be available starting in the spring, with pricing starting at &#36;1,300.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2026/\">CES 2026</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/pioneer/\">Pioneer</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/05/first-aftermarket-carplay-unit-with-spatial-audio/\">CES 2026: Pioneer Announces First Aftermarket CarPlay Unit With Spatial Audio</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2026-pioneer-announces-first-aftermarket-carplay-unit-with-spatial-audio.2475620/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

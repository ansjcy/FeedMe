Likewise, it is possible that iOS 26.3.1 will include support for some of the new products that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/22/five-new-apple-products-next-week/\">expected to announce in the first week of March</a>, such as the iPhone 17e, but this is merely speculation at this point.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is reportedly planning a three-day stretch of product announcements from Monday, March 2 through Wednesday, March 4. Selected journalists and content creators are expected to receive hands-on time with the products <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/apple-announces-special-event-in-new-york/\">at an \"Apple Experience\" in New York, London, and Shanghai</a> on Wednesday, March 4 at 9 a.m. Eastern Time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe have not confirmed if there will be any corresponding updates, such as macOS 26.3.1.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\niOS 26.3.1 will be a stopgap update between <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/apple-releases-ios-26-3-and-ipados-26-3/\">iOS 26.3</a>, released earlier this month, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/ios-26-4-public-beta-1/\">iOS 26.4</a>, which will likely arrive in late March or early April. While it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/ios-26-4-no-new-siri-features/\">lacks the personalized version of Siri</a>, iOS 26.4 is shaping up to be a relatively significant update that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-4-beta-features/\">adds many new features</a> across Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, CarPlay, and more.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/22/ios-26-3-1-coming-soon/\">iOS 26.3.1 Update for iPhones Coming Soon as &#039;Apple Experience&#039; Nears</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-3-1-update-for-iphones-coming-soon-as-apple-experience-nears.2478077/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

In total, he expects Apple to introduce \"at least five products.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Apple-Announces-Special-Event-in-New-York-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1888\" height=\"1063\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036546\" />\r<br/>\nA week ago, Apple invited selected journalists and content creators to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/apple-announces-special-event-in-new-york/\">\"Apple Experience\" in New York, London, and Shanghai</a> on Wednesday, March 4 at 9 a.m. Eastern Time. At these in-person gatherings, the expectation is that attendees will receive hands-on time with the new products that Apple announces next week.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGiven this launch is described as an \"Apple Experience,\" it appears there will not be a traditional Apple Event live stream. Instead, the new products are expected to be unveiled in a series of press releases on the Apple Newsroom website.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/20/low-cost-macbook-latest-rumors/\">lower-cost MacBook</a> will \"very likely\" be one of the new products introduced next week, according to Gurman. Rumored features include a 12.9-inch display, a version of the iPhone 16 Pro's A18 Pro chip, and a variety of fun color options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGurman expects the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/iphone-17e-launch-imminent-with-four-features/\">iPhone 17e</a> to debut by the first week of March. The device is expected to have four key upgrades over the iPhone 16e, including an A19 chip, MagSafe, Apple's C1X modem for faster 5G, and Apple's N1 chip for Wi-Fi 7.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOther potential products coming next week include an iPad Air with the M4 chip, an iPad 12 with the A18 chip, a MacBook Air with the M5 chip, and MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/20/macos-26-3-code-three-new-apple-products/\">Two new Studio Displays</a> are reportedly in the works too, but Gurman said it might be \"overkill\" for those to arrive next week.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn any case, it sounds like Apple's next products are just days away. This launch comes after Apple released a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-announces-new-airtag/\">second-generation AirTag</a> last month.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/checkout?id=D28F04\"><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/MacRumors-x-Bloomberg-Banner-Cool.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"559\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007163\" /></a><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/22/five-new-apple-products-next-week/\">Apple Reportedly Plans to Unveil at Least Five New Products Next Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-plans-to-unveil-at-least-five-new-products-next-week.2478062/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "It looks like our first major Apple product announcements of 2026 are right around the corner, with Apple announcing a \"special Apple Experience\" for members of the media scheduled for March 4 where we're expecting to see them get hands-on time with several newly announced products.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/top-stories-2026-02-21.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1037050\" />\r<br/>\nIn other Apple news this week, the first betas of iOS 26.4 and related updates include some new features and enhancements, while we heard a bit more about the iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max coming later this year, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Top Stories</h2>\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Announces Special Event in New York, London, and Shanghai on March 4</h3>\r<br/>\nApple this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/apple-announces-special-event-in-new-york/\">invited members of the media to a \"special Apple Experience\"</a> taking place simultaneously in New York, London, and Shanghai on Wednesday, March 4.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Apple-Announces-Special-Event-in-New-York-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1888\" height=\"1063\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036546\" />\r<br/>\nRather than a traditional Apple event, it sounds like these \"experiences\" will be opportunities for the media to get hands-on time with a variety of products being announced at the start of or slightly before the event time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt actually sounds like we may be getting <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/apple-announcements-first-week-of-march/\">several days of press release announcements</a> in the first part of the week, culminating in the media experiences on Wednesday. While we don't know exactly what products will be announced that week, there are a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/apple-event-march-2026-preview/\">host of new products expected in the near future</a> including the iPhone 17e, M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro models, new iPads, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Everything New in iOS 26.4 Beta 1</h3>\r<br/>\nFollowing last week's release of iOS 26.3, Apple this week seeded the first betas of iOS 26.4 and related updates.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/iOS-26.4-Whats-New-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036532\" />\r<br/>\nWhile it doesn't include the more personalized Siri we had been hoping for, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-4-beta-features/\">there are a bunch of changes and new features</a> in the update.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOne of the more interesting changes being prepped for in the release is support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/ios-26-4-major-new-carplay-feature-revealed/\">CarPlay video over AirPlay</a>, which will allow users to stream Apple TV and other video content to their car's infotainment screen while their vehicle is parked.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Five iPhone 18 Pro Features Revealed in New Report</h3>\r<br/>\nWhile the iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max should have very similar designs to their predecessors, they are likely to be getting an array of new features and upgrades to attract customers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/Coffee-Burgundy-and-Purple-iPhone-18-Pro-Mock.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025606\" />\r<br/>\nResearch analyst Jeff Pu recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/five-iphone-18-pro-features-revealed-in-new-report/\">outlined five upgrades he's expecting to see</a> in the new models, and we've recapped a full list of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/reasons-to-wait-iphone-18-pro/\">ten reasons why you might want to wait</a> for the new models if you're considering buying now.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Reveals How Many iPhones Are Running iOS 26</h3>\r<br/>\nWith the transition to the controversial new Liquid Glass design in iOS 26, some users appear to have been holding off on upgrading, but new data released by Apple last week suggests the impact is relatively small.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/iOS-26-Glass-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1016183\" />\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/apple-shares-ios-26-adoption-stats/\">Apple adoption data</a> shows roughly the same share of devices are running iOS 26 at this point as were running iOS 18 a year ago, although the company did wait three weeks longer to release data this year. So while it appears adoption is lagging a bit this year, it's not a massive difference.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Toyota Rolling Out Apple Wallet Car Keys on iPhone</h3>\r<br/>\nToyota, the world's largest car manufacturer, is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/toyota-apple-wallet-car-keys/\">finally rolling out support for Apple's digital car key feature</a>, allowing users to lock, unlock, and start compatible vehicles from the Wallet app on their iPhone or Apple Watch.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Toyota-Rav4-Car-Key-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036635\" />\r<br/>\nSigns of the impending support were discovered back in December, and we've seen our first report of vehicles in the wild supporting it with the new 2026 RAV4.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Launching New 'Sales Coach' App</h3>\r<br/>\nApple plans to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/apple-launching-sales-coach-app/\">launch a rebranded \"Sales Coach\" app</a> on the iPhone and iPad later this month, according to a source familiar with the matter.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Apple-Sales-Coach-App.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036364\" />\r<br/>\n\"Sales Coach\" will arrive as an update to Apple's existing \"SEED\" app, and it will continue to provide sales tips and training resources to Apple Store and Apple Authorized Reseller employees around the world. For example, there are articles and videos highlighting everything from reasons to upgrade to a newer iPhone to popular iPad features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>MacRumors Newsletter</h2>\r<br/>\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/feb-19-2026\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/21/top-stories-apple-event-march-4/\">Top Stories: Apple Event on March 4, iOS 26.4 Beta, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-apple-event-on-march-4-ios-26-4-beta-and-more.2478017/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

This is going to be one of Apple's most unique Macs, because there hasn't really been anything quite like it before.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/Low-Cost-A18-Pro-MacBook-Feature-Pink.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028724\" />\r<br/>\nWe've rounded up everything we know about the low-cost MacBook ahead of its March debut.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Design</h2>\r<br/>\nRumors about the MacBook's design make it sound a lot like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>. It will have an aluminum chassis in various colors, and a 12.9-inch or 13-inch display, depending on the rumor.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Multicolored-Low-Cost-A18-Pro-MacBook-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036750\" />\r<br/>\nIt's possible the low-cost MacBook will have a thin and light design because it's going to use a lower power A-series chip that doesn't require a lot of heat dissipation, but that's not yet confirmed. Apple used to have a 12-inch MacBook with a thin design and a low-power Core M chip, and it's been suggested that this new MacBook could be something of a revival of that machine.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThinner and lighter typically means more expensive with Apple products, so a super slim design might not be what Apple is optimizing for. Making the low-cost MacBook thinner than the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; could just confuse the MacBook lineup.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith the low-cost <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, Apple keeps the price down by using older display technology that's not as thin, so we could see that same strategy with the low-cost MacBook. A thicker chassis and a super efficient chip could mean a long battery life, which would be ideal for an educational environment.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Colors</h2>\r<br/>\nThe MacBook is going to come in a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/low-cost-macbook-yellow-green-blue-pink/\">selection of fun colors</a>, and Apple has tested light yellow, light green, blue, pink, silver, and dark gray, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>. Not all of those colors are likely to ship, but it sounds like we'll get at least four of them.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> thinks the MacBook will come in yellow, silver, blue, and pink, which would be the same colors that Apple offers for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>A-Series Chip</h2>\r<br/>\nThe most consistent rumor we've heard about the MacBook is its planned chip. Rather than an M-series Mac chip, Apple is planning to use an A-series chip. The low-cost MacBook is expected to use the A18 Pro chip, which Apple first debuted in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> Pro.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/A18-Pro-Chip.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-965379\" />\r<br/>\nThe A18 Pro uses a second-generation 3-nanometer process. It has a 6-core CPU with four performance cores and two efficiency cores, along with a 6-core GPU and a 16-core Neural Engine for AI-based tasks. In Geekbench benchmarks, the A18 Pro has an average single-core score of 3451, and a multi-core score of 8572. For comparison, the M4 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> earns a single-core score of 3694 and a multi-core score of 13732 (Apple's next &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is going to use the M4 chip).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A18 Pro outperforms the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a>, which is the chip that Apple kept around in a lower-cost version of the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; for several years. An A18 MacBook wouldn't be too far off from the M4 Mac/&zwnj;iPad&zwnj; chips in terms of single-core performance, but there would be a difference in multi-core performance.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA MacBook with the A18 chip would be more than powerful enough for day-to-day use like web browsing, document creation, watching videos, and even light photo and video editing. It won't be ideal for system-intensive games or tasks like 4K video editing and 3D rendering, but it will do almost everything an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; can do.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is developing the low-cost MacBook with students in mind, and it sounds like it will be the Apple equivalent of the affordable Chromebook PCs that are often used by students.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>RAM</h2>\r<br/>\nMacs start with 16GB RAM, but the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro has 8GB RAM, the minimum for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>. We can expect an A18 Pro MacBook to have at least 8GB RAM so it can support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, but it's possible Apple will give it the 16GB that all Macs have.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Storage</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; starts with 256GB of storage, but Apple could possibly launch the low-cost MacBook with 128GB.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Ports</h2>\r<br/>\nThe A18 Pro chip in the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro models doesn't support Thunderbolt, so the MacBook will be limited to USB-C (10GB/s) and won't offer Thunderbolt speeds. That will limit display connectivity, so it's likely the A18 Pro MacBook will only support a single external display.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Naming</h2>\r<br/>\nIt's not really clear what Apple will name the low-cost Mac notebook. We have the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>, so it's entirely possible it will be called \"MacBook.\" Apple has used the MacBook name multiple times in the past, and it's not in use at the moment.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Price</h2>\r<br/>\nPricing on the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; starts at &#36;999, and the low-cost MacBook is expected to be priced much lower.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple probably won't want to undercut its &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; pricing by too much. The low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; with A16 chip starts at &#36;349, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip starts at &#36;599. A price between &#36;599 and &#36;799 could make the most sense because it wouldn't be as expensive as the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, but would come in at or just over the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;'s cost.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&#36;599 would be on par with some of the highly rated Chromebook options that people often purchase for school use, while a &#36;699 or &#36;799 price would be in the same general pricing area, but a little more of a premium price tag. &#36;599 is also the cost of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a>, Apple's most affordable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that uses a slightly less powerful A18 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Launch Date</h2>\r<br/>\nRumors suggest that the low-cost MacBook will be introduced at or just before Apple's March 4 Special Experience that's taking place in New York, London, and Shanghai. Apple could announce the MacBook in a press release ahead of the experience.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSelect members of the media have been invited to the mini event, and it's likely to provide them with a chance to try the new MacBook and other new devices.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/20/low-cost-macbook-latest-rumors/\">Apple&#039;s Low-Cost Colorful MacBook: All the Rumors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-low-cost-colorful-macbook-all-the-rumors.2478001/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

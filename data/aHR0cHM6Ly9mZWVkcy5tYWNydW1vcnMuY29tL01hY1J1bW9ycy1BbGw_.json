      "content": "TSMC has been the exclusive supplier of Apple's systems-on-a-chip since 2014, but that 12-year streak could be nearing its end.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-silicon-feature-joeblue.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-945652\" />\r<br/>\nAccording <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/the-ai-boom-is-coming-for-apples-profit-margins-4774013d\">to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Apple is exploring whether some of its lower-end processors could be manufactured by a company other than TSMC.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"Now that TSMC is doing more business with Nvidia and other AI companies, people with knowledge of the chip supply chain said Apple was exploring whether some lower-end processors could be made by someone other than TSMC,\" the report said.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe report did not mention any candidates, but previous rumors have indicated that Intel could begin supplying some lower-end Apple processors in 2027 or 2028.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA few months ago, GF Securities analyst Jeff Pu said that he expected Intel to reach a chip supply deal with Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/23/apple-intel-iphone-chips-rumor/\">for at least some non-pro iPhone models starting in 2028</a>. Based on that timeframe, Intel could supply Apple with at least a portion of A21 or A22 chips for future iPhone models, if the companies agree to a partnership.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's return to Intel <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/28/intel-rumored-to-supply-new-mac-chip/\">might also involve some Mac and iPad chips</a>. Last year, Tianfeng Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he expected Intel to begin shipping Apple's lowest-end M-series chip for select Mac and iPad models as early as mid-2027. For this, Kuo said Apple planned to utilize Intel's 18A process. He did not mention the iPhone.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere is no indication that Intel would play a role in designing the iPhone chips, with its involvement expected to be strictly limited to fabrication. That would differ from the era of Intel Macs, which used Intel-designed processors with x86 architecture. Apple began transitioning away from Intel processors in Macs in 2020.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIntel would help Apple diversify its supply chain, which could come at a pivotal time, as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/28/nvidia-replaces-apple-as-biggest-tsmc-customer/\">Nvidia has reportedly surpassed Apple as TSMC's largest customer</a> amid <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/apple-to-weather-dram-price-surge/\">rising competition for NAND memory and RAM chip supply</a> for AI servers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTSMC is not the only chip supplier seeing increased demand amid the AI server boom, as Samsung and SK Hynix have both gained enough leverage to demand Apple pay more for RAM chips, according to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s supply chain sources.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOn an earnings call last week, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/29/apple-responds-to-rising-memory-chip-prices/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook said</a> that rising memory chip prices had a \"minimal impact\" on Apple's gross margin last quarter, but he does expect a \"bit more of an impact\" on the company's gross margin in the current quarter. He said Apple \"will look at a range of options to deal with that\" as necessary.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/27/apple-iphone-18-starting-price-steady/\">does not expect price increases</a> for the iPhone 18 lineup.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple reported <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/29/apple-1q-2026-earnings/\">record-breaking revenue</a> of &#36;143.8 billion last quarter, up 16% year-over-year, and it is predicting similar 13% to 16% year-over-year growth and gross margin of 48% to 49% in the current quarter, so the company is still reporting impressive earnings results despite concerns surrounding memory chip prices.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-wall-street-journal/\">The Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/\">TSMC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/01/apple-may-break-12-year-old-chip-strategy/\">Apple May Break a 12-Year Chip Strategy</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-may-break-a-12-year-chip-strategy.2477027/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Nearly nine months later, CarPlay Ultra is still <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/first-look-at-carplay-ultra/\">limited to Aston Martin's latest luxury vehicles</a>, but that should change fairly soon.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Aston-Martin-CarPlay-Ultra-Screen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034779\" />\r<br/>\nIn May 2025, Apple said many other vehicle brands planned to offer CarPlay Ultra, including Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis. At the time, it said CarPlay Ultra would begin expanding to more vehicles around the world \"in the next 12 months.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-01/apple-s-record-quarter-and-ai-changes-macbook-pro-update-clamshell-iphone-fold\"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said he was told that CarPlay Ultra will come to at least one major new Hyundai or Kia vehicle model \"in the second half of this year.\" It is unclear if he is referring to Hyundai's upcoming IONIQ 3, as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/31/next-carplay-ultra-vehicle-report/\">previously reported</a>, or if it will be a different model. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCarPlay Ultra features deeper integration with a vehicle's instrument cluster and systems, built-in apps for radio and climate controls, rear-view camera feed support, and more. The connected iPhone provides app-related data, while the vehicle provides information like the current speed, fuel level, tire pressure, engine temperature, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Aston-Martin-CarPlay-Ultra-Climate-Controls.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034780\" />\r<br/>\nThe interface is tailored to each vehicle model and automaker's identity, and drivers can choose from various preset design options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/24/bmw-confirms-no-plans-to-offer-carplay-ultra/\">BMW</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/29/ford-ceo-provides-update-on-carplay-ultra/\">Ford</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/06/rivian-ceo-doubles-down-on-skipping-carplay/\">Rivian</a> are among the brands that have publicly downplayed CarPlay Ultra, while General Motors controversially ditched the regular version of CarPlay <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/gm-further-explains-phasing-out-carplay/\">in its new electric vehicles</a>, so it is likely to pass on CarPlay Ultra too. That means vehicles from brands like Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC are likely out of the running.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt is improbable that Tesla would offer CarPlay Ultra either, but it is reportedly working on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/13/tesla-to-add-carplay-support/\">offering the regular version of CarPlay</a> in a major pivot.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/checkout?id=D28F04\"><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/MacRumors-x-Bloomberg-Banner-Cool.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"559\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007163\" /></a><div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/carplay-ultra/\">CarPlay Ultra</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/01/carplay-ultra-to-expand-this-year/\">Apple&#039;s CarPlay Ultra to Expand to These Vehicle Brands Later This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-carplay-ultra-to-expand-to-these-vehicle-brands-later-this-year.2477009/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a> Max has the biggest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; battery to date at 5,088 mAh.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCompeting foldables already on the market feature a noticeably smaller battery than the rumored size. The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold has a battery capacity of 5,015 mAh, while the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 has a 4,400 mAh battery. As a result, any foldable smartphone from Apple with a battery over 5,500 mAh in size would be class-leading. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLast year, the leaker known as \"yeux1122\" said that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/18/apple-foldable-biggest-iphone-battery/\">testing a battery</a> for the device in the 5,400–5,800 mAh range, citing supply chain sources. A <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/foldable-iphone-impressive-battery-life-thinness/\">March report</a> from the same Korean account claimed that Apple has placed a heavy focus on improving power efficiency while slimming down key components of its foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, with battery life said to be a key priority for the company.

Nevertheless, he said a clamshell iPhone is \"far from guaranteed to reach the market.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/checkout?id=D28F04\"><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/MacRumors-x-Bloomberg-Banner-Cool.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"559\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007163\" /></a><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-flip/\">iPhone Flip</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/01/apple-is-exploring-an-iphone-flip/\">Apple is Exploring an &#039;iPhone Flip&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-is-exploring-an-iphone-flip.2477006/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Gurman was careful to also mention March, but this seems rather unlikely, unless the macOS 26.3 beta testing cycle drags on longer than expected, or the new MacBook Pro models are tied to macOS 26.3.1 or later.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs of now, we expect the macOS 26.3 Release Candidate to be seeded in the first half of February, so a new MacBook Pro announcement could be just around the corner.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn October, <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/10/10/macos-tahoe-itself-has-leaked-2025-and-2026-mac-release-timelines\"><em>AppleInsider</em>'s Marko Zivkovic was first to report</a> that MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips were \"expected to ship with macOS 26.3,\" so this rumor has now been shared by multiple sources.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBeyond the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, no major changes are expected for these models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn late 2026 or in 2027, the MacBook Pro is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/25/macbook-pro-two-upgrades-in-2026-rumor/\">expected to receive a major redesign</a>, with rumored features including an OLED display with touch capabilities, M6 Pro and M6 Max chips, a thinner design, and built-in cellular connectivity.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/checkout?id=D28F04\"><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/MacRumors-x-Bloomberg-Banner-Cool.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"559\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007163\" /></a><div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/\">macOS Tahoe</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">MacBook Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-tahoe.250\">macOS Tahoe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/01/new-macbook-pro-macos-26-3-rumor/\">New MacBook Pros Reportedly Launching Alongside macOS 26.3</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-macbook-pros-reportedly-launching-alongside-macos-26-3.2476995/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

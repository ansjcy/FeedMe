      "content": "Even without any announcements from Apple, CES dominated tech news this week with a host of upcoming products and technologies being demonstrated at the annual expo in Las Vegas.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/top-stories-2026-01-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031756\" />\r<br/>\nOther news in the Apple world this week included official word that the Apple Card will shift from Goldman Sachs to Chase, while iOS 26 appears to be showing extremely slow adoption rates amid the controversial Liquid Glass redesign, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Top Stories</h2>\r<br/>\n<h3>CES 2026 Hub: Highlights From the Show</h3>\r<br/>\nThe annual <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2026/\">consumer electronics show CES was once again held this week in Las Vegas</a>. AI and robots were some of the high-profile areas of focus this year, and even though Apple itself doesn't officially attend the show, we still saw a variety of more traditional products that are always popular with Apple fans.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/CES-2026-Day-1-Thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031417\" />\r<br/>\nOne of the products shown at the show that appears to be more directly relevant to Apple came from Samsung, which briefly showed off its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/06/foldable-iphone-display-previewed-ces-2026/\">new crease-less foldable OLED display panel</a>. The panel is rumored to be destined for Apple's upcoming foldable iPhone expected to debut later this year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnother item at CES that has proven popular is the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/02/clicks-communicator/\">Clicks Communicator</a>, a new Android smartphone intended to be carried as a second phone for focus on communication rather than consumption, with Clicks calling it akin to a Kindle's relationship to the iPad.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2026/\">Check out our CES 2026 news hub</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@macrumors/videos\">head over to our YouTube channel</a> for our daily videos from the show floor.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Card Will Move From Goldman Sachs to JPMorgan Chase</h3>\r<br/>\nAfter over two years of rumors, the move is now official: Goldman Sachs is giving up the Apple Card business with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/07/jpmorgan-chase-apple-card-takeover/\">JPMorgan Chase to become the new partner for Apple's credit card and savings account business</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Apple-Card-iPhone-16-Pro-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2049\" height=\"1153\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-985779\" />\r<br/>\nThe transition will take around two years to play out, and in the meantime Apple Card customers can continue using their cards as usual.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>iOS 26 Shows Unusually Slow Adoption Months After Release</h3>\r<br/>\niOS 26 is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/08/ios-26-shows-unusually-slow-adoption/\">showing unusually slow adoption</a> among iPhone users months after release, according to third-party analytics.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/iOS-26-Glass-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1016183\" />\r<br/>\nUsage data published by StatCounter for January 2026 indicates that only around 15 to 16% of active iPhones worldwide are running any version of ‌iOS 26‌. Historical comparisons highlight how atypical this adoption curve appears. StatCounter data from January 2025 shows that roughly 63% of iPhones were running some version of iOS 18 about four months after its release. In January 2024, iOS 17 had reached approximately 54% adoption over a similar timeframe, while iOS 16 surpassed 60% adoption by January 2023.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Logitech Blames 'Inexcusable Mistake' After Certificate Expiry Breaks macOS Apps</h3>\r<br/>\nLogitech users on macOS <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/07/logitech-certificate-breaks-macos-apps/\">found themselves locked out of their mouse customizations</a> this week after the company let a security certificate expire, breaking both its Logi Options+ and G HUB configuration apps.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/Logitech-MX-Master-3S.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-982275\" />\r<br/>\nLogitech devices like the MX Master series mice and MX Keys keyboards stopped working properly as a result of the oversight, with users unable to access their custom scrolling setup, button mappings, and gestures. It wasn't long before the Logitech subreddit was awash with frustrated reports as people discovered their configured peripherals had suddenly reverted to default settings.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLogitech quickly issued updates to address the issue, but they require a manual update as the problem left the auto-updating feature unusable since the apps were unable to open.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>OpenAI Launches ChatGPT Health With Apple Health Integration</h3>\r<br/>\nOpenAI this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/02/chatgpt-apple-health-connector/\">announced the launch of ChatGPT Health</a>, a dedicated section of ChatGPT where users can ask health-related questions completely separated from their main ChatGPT experience.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/ChatGPT-Health-Integration-Connectors-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028892\" />\r<br/>\nFor more personalized responses, users can connect various health data services such as Apple Health, Function, MyFitnessPal, Weight Watchers, AllTrails, Instacart, and Peloton. Once connected to Apple Health, ChatGPT will be able to access your health and fitness data, including movement, sleep, and activity patterns.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Low-Price 12.9-Inch MacBook With A18 Pro Chip Reportedly Launching Early This Year</h3>\r<br/>\nApple plans to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/02/12-9-inch-macbook-spring-2026-rumor/\">introduce a 12.9-inch MacBook in spring 2026</a>, according to TrendForce. The Taiwanese research firm says this MacBook will be aimed at the entry-level to mid-range market, with \"competitive pricing.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/Low-Cost-A18-Pro-MacBook-Feature-Pink.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028724\" />\r<br/>\nTrendForce did not share any further details about this MacBook, but the information that it shared lines up with several rumors about a more affordable MacBook, which is expected to be equipped with a version of the iPhone 16 Pro's A18 Pro chip. Apple is expected to release the laptop by March or April of this year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor more on this budget MacBook, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/02/low-cost-macbook-pro-rumors/\">check out our recap of everything we've heard about it so far</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>MacRumors Newsletter</h2>\r<br/>\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/jan-8-2026\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/10/top-stories-ces-2026-highlights/\">Top Stories: CES 2026 Highlights, Apple Card Moving to Chase, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-ces-2026-highlights-apple-card-moving-to-chase-and-more.2475843/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; was initially available only in a 15-inch size, with a 17-inch model following a few months later. A 13-inch aluminum MacBook debuted in October 2008, and after just one generation it was folded into the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; lineup in 2009.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe original ‌&zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;‌ came in two configurations, both with 15.4-inch widescreen displays at a resolution of 1,440 &times; 900 pixels. As announced, the entry-level model priced at &#36;1,999 featured a 1.67GHz Core Duo processor, 512MB of 667MHz DDR2 RAM, and an 80GB hard drive, while the higher-end model priced at &#36;2,499 offered a faster 1.83GHz Core Duo processor, 1GB of RAM, and a 100GB hard drive.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBy the time the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2006/02/14/macbook-pro-now-shipping-plus-speed-bump/\">started shipping a month later</a>, however, Apple had already upgraded the available Core Duo chips to 1.83GHz in the base model and 2.0GHz in the high-end configuration, while also introducing an even higher-end 2.16GHz build-to-order option.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith its lengthy 20-year history, the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; has gone through a lot of changes over its lifetime, adopting key features like a built-in webcam, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> power connector, aluminum unibody construction, high-resolution Retina displays, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOther features were not so well received, including the revolutionary Touch Bar in place of traditional function keys and the butterfly-mechanism keyboard that proved prone to failures and resulted in an extended repair program and multiple class action lawsuits.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn 2020, the 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; was one of three Apple products, alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, to receive the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip, marking a generational shift for Apple away from Intel processors and into its own custom Apple silicon. The move freed Apple up from having to follow the cadence of Intel chip releases, and it allowed Apple to further tighten the integration between hardware and software, leading to significant leaps in performance and efficiency.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLooking toward the future, the next big revolution for the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; appears to be coming fairly soon, with rumors indicating we <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/10/m6-macbook-pro-release-date-pricing-what-to-expect/\">should see a major redesign</a> for the higher-end models with OLED displays, touchscreen support, and perhaps an iPhone-like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a> cutout in the display in either late 2026 or early 2027. Apple is said to also be planning for thinner and lighter designs, making Apple's most powerful laptops even more portable.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/10/macbook-pro-20-years-old/\">Apple&#039;s MacBook Pro Turns 20 Years Old</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-macbook-pro-turns-20-years-old.2475840/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The deadline for updating was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-ending-support-old-homekit-architecture/\">originally announced as fall 2025</a>, but in early November, Apple announced that it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/03/apple-delays-home-app-update-requirement/\">pushing back the deadline to February 10, 2026</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt appears Apple will be sticking with that deadline, as the company is sending out fresh reminder emails today to users who have yet to upgrade to the new version of Apple Home.<blockquote>This email serves as your second reminder that support for the earlier version of Apple Home will <strong>end next month</strong> on <strong>February 10, 2026</strong>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf you do not update to this new version of Apple Home, your access to your home within the Home app might be blocked, accessories and automations might not work as expected, and you will not receive important security fixes and performance improvements. Updating to the new version of Apple Home can also enable new features, such as guest access, support for robot vacuum cleaners, Activity History, and more.</blockquote>Users can update to the new version of Apple Home within the Software Update section of Home Settings in the Home app. If you have already completed these steps, or \"This home and all accessories are up to date\" is shown in Software Update, then you are already on the current version and there is nothing more you need to do.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNotably, the new version of Apple Home <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/102287\">requires a minimum of iOS 16.2, iPadOS 16.2, macOS 13.1, tvOS 16.2, and watchOS 9.2</a>, and older devices that have not been or cannot be updated will lose access to the Apple Home after updating. This requirement has not sat well with some users who may use older devices as dedicated Home control devices, so many of these users have put off upgrading their Home architecture for as long as possible, but it now appears the reprieve is coming to an end.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home/\">Home</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/09/apple-home-app-upgrade-reminder/\">Apple Reminding Users of Pending Home App Upgrade Requirement</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reminding-users-of-pending-home-app-upgrade-requirement.2475820/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

In response, X appears to have scaled back the ability for Grok to generate images in response to X posts by non-paying users, but <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/859309/grok-undressing-limit-access-gaslighting\"><em>The Verge</em> notes</a> that the tools remain available to paying subscribers and through the dedicated Grok tab in the X and in the standalone Grok app.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe senators argue that the \"harmful and likely illegal depictions\" are in violation of Apple's and Google's app store terms and that the two companies must remove the apps until the policy violations are addressed.<blockquote>. . . Apple's terms of service bar apps from including \"offensive\" or \"just plain creepy\" content, which under any definition must include nonconsensually-generated sexualized images of children and women. Further, Apple's terms explicitly bar apps from including content that is \"[o]vertly sexual or pornographic material\" including material \"intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTurning a blind eye to X's egregious behavior would make a mockery of your moderation practices. Indeed, not taking action would undermine your claims in public and in court that your app stores offer a safer user experience than letting users download apps directly to their phones. This principle has been core to your advocacy against legislative reforms to increase app store competition and your defenses to claims that your app stores abuse their market power through their payment systems.</blockquote>The senators request a written response to their letter by January 23.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/grok/\">Grok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/09/senators-apple-google-remove-grok/\">U.S. Senators Ask Apple and Google to Remove X and Grok Apps Over Sexualized Image Generation</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/u-s-senators-ask-apple-and-google-to-remove-x-and-grok-apps-over-sexualized-image-generation.2475818/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple this week secured another victory in its ongoing legal dispute with heart monitoring company AliveCor, after a federal appeals court upheld a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-wins-alivecor-antitrust-fight/\">2024 ruling</a> that found Apple's changes to the Apple Watch were lawful product improvements rather than anticompetitive behavior.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/03/Kardia-Band-apple-watch.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-493409\" />\r<br/>\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court decision that rejected AliveCor's antitrust claims. AliveCor had argued that Apple illegally monopolized the market for heart rate analysis apps on watchOS when it replaced its Heart Rate during Physical Observation (HRPO) algorithm with its heart rate neural network (HRNN) algorithm in watchOS 5. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAliveCor claimed that Apple changed the algorithm so that its ECG KardiaBand could no longer identify irregular heart rhythms – as part of an alleged effort to \"eliminate opposition\" in the heart rate analysis space – and requested that it reinstate the old algorithm.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple argued that AliveCor did not have the right to dictate Apple's design decisions, and that the request to support the older heart rate technology would require the court to be a day-to-day enforcer of how Apple engineers its products. The court ultimately agreed with Apple.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Ninth Circuit has now affirmed Apple's victory. \"The undisputed evidence shows as a matter of law that Apple's refusal to share HRPO data was not anticompetitive,\" <a href=\"https://content.mlex.com/Attachments/2024-02-13_96R1Q69F5VP38H27/Alivecor%20v%20Apple%20order.pdf\">the court wrote</a>. It added that even if some form of heart rate data access were essential for competing in the market, AliveCor's claim would still fail because Apple provides app developers with access to the same Tachogram API data that Apple's Irregular Rhythm Notification feature uses.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe appeals court also rejected AliveCor's argument that Apple had a duty to share its proprietary data with competitors. The ruling said that antitrust laws generally impose no obligation for companies to deal with their rivals. It also noted that such a requirement \"would implicate the same concerns regarding incentives to innovate and judicial competency that the Supreme Court has articulated.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe decision is Apple's second major win against AliveCor within the last year. In March, the Federal Circuit <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-alivecor-itc-win/\">confirmed</a> the invalidation of three AliveCor patents related to heart rate monitoring, vacating an International Trade Commission ruling that could have led to an Apple Watch import ban.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAliveCor said at the time of the court's original ruling that it was \"deeply disappointed\" by the decision and would continue to explore all available legal options, including potential appeals.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/alivecor/\">AliveCor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">Apple Lawsuits</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/09/apple-wins-another-victory-alivecor-legal-battle/\">Apple Wins Another Round in AliveCor Legal Battle Over Heart Rate Tech</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wins-another-round-in-alivecor-legal-battle-over-heart-rate-tech.2475815/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

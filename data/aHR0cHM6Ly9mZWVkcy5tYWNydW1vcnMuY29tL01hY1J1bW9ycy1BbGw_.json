      "content": "Starting on Monday, we're going to get our first major product announcements of 2026. Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> teased a \"big week ahead\" with an \"Apple Launch\" hashtag, plus Apple has media events scheduled in New York, Shanghai, and London on Wednesday, March 4. We're expecting the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 17e, an all-new low-cost MacBook, and minor refreshes to the Mac and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> lines.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Apple-Announces-Special-Event-in-New-York-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1888\" height=\"1063\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036546\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"low-cost_macbook\">Low-Cost MacBook</h2>\r<br/>\nRumors about the MacBook's design make it sound a lot like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>. It will have an aluminum chassis in a range of colors, and a 12.9-inch or 13-inch display, depending on the rumor.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/Low-Cost-A18-Pro-MacBook-Feature-Pink.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028724\" />\r<br/>\nIt's possible the low-cost MacBook will have a thin and light design because it's going to use a lower power A-series chip that doesn't require a lot of heat dissipation, but that's not yet confirmed. Apple used to have a 12-inch MacBook with a thin design and a low-power Core M chip, and it's been suggested that this new MacBook could be something of a revival of that machine.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThinner and lighter typically means more expensive with Apple products, so a super slim design might not be what Apple is optimizing for. Making the low-cost MacBook thinner than the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; could just confuse the MacBook lineup.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, Apple keeps the price down by using older display technology that's not as thin, so we could see that same strategy with the low-cost MacBook. A thicker chassis and a super efficient chip could mean a long battery life, which would be ideal for an educational environment.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe low-cost MacBook is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/25/lower-cost-macbook-alleged-limitations/\">expected to have</a> lower max display brightness, no True Tone support, no backlit keyboard, slower SSD speeds, and no N1 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"colors\">Colors</h3>\r<br/>\nThe MacBook is going to come in a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/low-cost-macbook-yellow-green-blue-pink/\">selection of fun colors</a>, and Apple has tested light yellow, light green, blue, pink, silver, and dark gray, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>. Not all of those colors are likely to ship, but it sounds like we'll get at least four of them.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Multicolored-Low-Cost-A18-Pro-MacBook-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036750\" />\r<br/>\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> thinks the MacBook will come in yellow, silver, blue, and pink, which would be the same colors that Apple offers for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"a18_pro_chip\">A18 Pro Chip</h3>\r<br/>\nThe most consistent rumor we've heard about the MacBook is its planned chip. Rather than an M-series Mac chip, Apple is planning to use an A-series chip. The low-cost MacBook is expected to use the A18 Pro chip, which Apple first debuted in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> Pro.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A18 Pro uses a second-generation 3-nanometer process. It has a 6-core CPU with four performance cores and two efficiency cores, along with a 6-core GPU and a 16-core Neural Engine for AI-based tasks. In Geekbench benchmarks, the A18 Pro has an average single-core score of 3451, and a multi-core score of 8572. For comparison, the M4 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> earns a single-core score of 3694 and a multi-core score of 13732 (Apple's next &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is going to use the M5 chip).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A18 Pro outperforms the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a>, which is the chip that Apple kept around in a lower-cost version of the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; for several years. An A18 MacBook wouldn't be too far off from the M4 Mac/&zwnj;iPad&zwnj; chips in terms of single-core performance, but there would be a difference in multi-core performance.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA MacBook with the A18 chip would be more than powerful enough for day-to-day use like web browsing, document creation, watching videos, and even light photo and video editing. It won't be ideal for system-intensive games or tasks like 4K video editing and 3D rendering, but it will do almost everything an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; can do.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is developing the low-cost MacBook with students in mind, and it sounds like it will be the Apple equivalent of the affordable Chromebook PCs that are often used by students.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"ram\">RAM</h3>\r<br/>\nMacs start with 16GB RAM, but the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro has 8GB RAM, the minimum for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>. We can expect an A18 Pro MacBook to have at least 8GB RAM so it can support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, but it's possible Apple will give it the 16GB that all Macs have.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"storage\">Storage</h3>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; starts with 256GB of storage, but Apple could possibly launch the low-cost MacBook with 128GB.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"ports\">Ports</h3>\r<br/>\nThe A18 Pro chip in the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro models doesn't support Thunderbolt, so the MacBook will be limited to USB-C (10GB/s) and won't offer Thunderbolt speeds. That will limit display connectivity, so it's likely the A18 Pro MacBook will only support a single external display.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"price\">Price</h3>\r<br/>\nPricing on the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; starts at &#36;999, and the low-cost MacBook is expected to be priced much lower.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple probably won't want to undercut its &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; pricing by too much. The low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; with A16 chip starts at &#36;349, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip starts at &#36;599. A price between &#36;599 and &#36;799 could make the most sense because it wouldn't be as expensive as the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, but would come in at or just over the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;'s cost.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&#36;599 would be on par with some of the highly rated Chromebook options that people often purchase for school use, while a &#36;699 or &#36;799 price would be in the same general pricing area, but a little more of a premium price tag. &#36;599 is also the cost of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a>, Apple's most affordable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that uses a slightly less powerful A18 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"iphone_17e\">iPhone 17e</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; that came out in February 2025 is due for a refresh. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is getting some useful upgrades over the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; that will make it even more worth the purchase price.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17e-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009543\" />\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"design\">Design</h3>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will look a lot like the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, featuring the same 6.1-inch display size, single-lens rear camera, and black and white color options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"display\">Display</h3>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to feature the same display panel as the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, which means it will be limited to a 60Hz refresh rate. Apple brought 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates to the standard <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> in 2025, but the same technology is not expected for the more affordable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will continue to be Apple's only new release &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; without 120Hz support.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n120Hz refresh rates provide video improvements and smoother scrolling when viewing webpages.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; does not have always-on display technology, and that's not likely to change with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e. To support always-on, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e would need an OLED display with 1-nit minimum brightness, which is limited to Apple's more expensive iPhones. HDR and brightness are also lacking compared to Apple's flagship lineup.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic_island\">Dynamic Island</h3>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; uses the notch that Apple has eliminated in its newer flagship iPhones, but the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e could eliminate it. Some rumors suggest that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will have a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a> instead of a notch, giving it an updated look.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; is a pill-shaped cutout on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display that houses the TrueDepth camera system and the front-facing camera. It takes up less display area than the notch, and it is better integrated into the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile some rumors indicate we could get a &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, other rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/iphone-17e-same-oled-panel-slimmer-bezels/\">continue to use a notch</a>, so the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; upgrade isn't a guarantee.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"a19_chip\">A19 Chip</h3>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will use Apple's A19 chip, which is the same chip that's in the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;. The A19 chip is built on an upgraded N3P 3-nanometer process, offering a 5 to 10 percent performance improvement over the A18 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple could be planning to use a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/06/iphone-17e-dynamic-island-a19-chip/\">downclocked version</a> of the A19 chip in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e, and if that's the case, its performance won't quite match the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;'s performance.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A18 chip that Apple used in the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; had a 4-core GPU instead of a 5-core GPU like the version from the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, so the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e could get a similar GPU downgrade.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAside from the improved CPU and GPU, the A19 has an updated display engine, image signal processor, and Neural Engine for improved AI performance. Every GPU core features a Neural Accelerator to boost the performance of local AI models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe are expecting the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e to continue to include 8GB RAM like the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;. Apple's other models have 12GB.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"magsafe_compatibility\">MagSafe Compatibility</h3>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; does not have a magnetic ring for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> charging, but the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to get a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; upgrade.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's iPhones have used &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; since the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12, so there are a wide array of &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; cases and accessories. The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is not compatible with these accessories, which is a major limitation.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSince it doesn't have &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is limited to 7.5W wireless charging speeds. &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; would upgrade that to at least 15W. The current &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models can charge at 25W over &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, though the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/\">iPhone Air</a> is limited to 20W.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"camera\">Camera</h3>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to have a single 48-megapixel Wide Angle camera at the back, with no upgrade rumored. The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; doesn't have a Camera Control button, and there's no sign that Apple plans to bring it to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e, either.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models got an upgraded 18-megapixel Center Stage front-facing camera, but rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will continue to use the same 12-megapixel front-facing camera as the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"c1x_modem_and_n1_chip\">C1X Modem and N1 Chip</h3>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will adopt Apple's C1X modem, the modem chip that Apple first debuted in the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;. The C1X modem is faster and more efficient than the C1 modem that Apple used in the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple says the C1X modem is up to 2x faster than the C1, and it is far more energy efficient than Qualcomm modems.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple could also update the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models with Apple's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth \"N1\" networking chip, bringing speed and efficiency improvements, plus Thread support. Leaked Apple code suggests the chip will not be included in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e in order to keep costs down, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/iphone-17e-launch-imminent-with-four-features/\">recent rumors indicate</a> Apple plans to include it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h3>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;599, and no price changes are expected for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"ipad_air\">iPad Air</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will get a small refresh with a chip update, adopting the M4 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/m3-ipad-air-spring-sale.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996418\" />\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"design_and_display\">Design and Display</h3>\r<br/>\nThere are no design changes rumored for the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, so we can expect the same 11-inch and 13-inch size options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is thicker and heavier than the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and it uses a standard LED display instead of OLED technology. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will eventually be upgraded to OLED, but for now, the higher-end display technology will remain limited to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; also doesn't support ProMotion, and there's no sign that Apple is planning to add it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will continue to feature USB-C, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> top button, and the same front and rear cameras.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt's possible there will be a new color option, but it's not guaranteed with a minor refresh. No new accessories are rumored, and it will continue to work with the Magic Keyboard and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> Pro.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"m4_chip\">M4 Chip</h3>\r<br/>\nApple has been updating the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; with an M-series chip that's a generation behind the chip in the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. Since the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; was updated in October 2025 with the M5, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is set to get the M4 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe M3 in the current &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and the M4 chip are both built on a 3-nanometer process, but the M4 has an updated process that brings speed and efficiency improvements.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are up to 10 CPU cores instead of 8, the Neural Engine is faster, and there's more memory bandwidth. The GPU is also more power efficient for potential battery gains. The M4 CPU is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3-vs-m4/\">up to 30 percent faster</a> than the M3 CPU, while the GPU is up to 21 percent faster.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; already supports &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, and the next-generation model will continue to do so. Apple increased the RAM in &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models with higher storage tiers, but there's no word on whether that same change will come to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. Current models feature 8GB RAM, the minimum for &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"charging\">Charging</h3>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; gained faster charging with the M5 update, and that's something that could trickle down to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"n1_chip\">N1 Chip</h3>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is likely to adopt the N1 networking chip that Apple first introduced in the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models. The N1 chip is an Apple-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip that offers connectivity and efficiency improvements compared to the third-party chips that Apple has used in previous devices. The N1 supports the latest Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6 technology.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe current &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; offers Wi-Fi 6E support, so the next-generation model could see faster Wi-Fi speeds on compatible networks with Wi-Fi 7.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"apple_modem\">Apple Modem</h3>\r<br/>\nApple used the C1X in the M5 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and the cellular versions of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will get that same modem chip. The C1X is an upgraded variant of the C1, Apple's first in-house modem chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt offers performance on par with Qualcomm chips, though 5G connectivity is limited to sub-6GHz with no support for mmWave 5G. That's not an issue on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, because the current version of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; doesn't support mmWave.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's modem chips are more power efficient than Qualcomm modem chips, and are able to better integrate with other &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; components.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h3>\r<br/>\nThere are no rumors of a price increase, so the 11-inch model is expected to continue to start at &#36;599, while the 13-inch model will start at &#36;799.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"low-cost_ipad\">Low-Cost iPad</h2>\r<br/>\nLike the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is going to get a refresh with an updated chip. The update is a bigger deal because the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is expected to support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; for the first time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/11th-gen-ipad-blue.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1008458\" />\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"design\">Design</h3>\r<br/>\nThe 12th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will have the same 11-inch edge-to-edge display with &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; Side Button and thick bezels as the current model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is only available in a single screen size, and it is Apple's thickest tablet at 7mm. It features a Retina LCD display with no ProMotion support, no P3 wide color, and no lamination (display technology that cuts down on glare, provides a more responsive feel, and allows for a thinner size) compared to Apple's other tablets.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple makes the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in several fun colors, and we could see some new shades in 2026. Current colors include blue, pink, silver, and yellow.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNo changes are expected for the rear camera, front camera, USB-C port, or compatibility with accessories like the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"a-series_chip\">A-Series Chip</h3>\r<br/>\nThe low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will be equipped with Apple's A18 or A19 chip, both of which are built on a 3-nanometer process. The upgraded chip will offer speed and efficiency improvements over the A16 chip that's in the current model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A16 chip that Apple used in 2025 does not support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, but the A18 and A19 do, so that will mark a major update for Apple's affordable tablet. The 2026 model will be able to support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features that are unavailable with the 2025 model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; has 6GB RAM, but Apple will need to bump that up to 8GB for &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"n1_chip\">N1 Chip</h3>\r<br/>\nApple is expanding its N1 networking chip to many of its new devices. The N1 chip supports Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread networking technology for smart home devices.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is limited to Wi-Fi 6, so if the 12th-generation version gets Wi-Fi 7, it will be able to connect to faster 6GHz networks for the first time. Bluetooth 6 would also be an improvement over Bluetooth 5.3. There is a chance that Apple is reserving the N1 chip for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/homepod-mini-2-chip-rumor/\">its more premium devices</a>, based on leaked internal code. If that's the case, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; won't include the N1 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"apple_modem\">Apple Modem</h3>\r<br/>\nApple has designed C1 and C1X modem chips that it has used in iPhones and iPads in 2025, and the next-generation version of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; could also get an Apple-designed modem chip for cellular models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h3>\r<br/>\nThe 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;349 for 128GB of storage, and there are so far no indications that pricing is going to change for the 12th-generation model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"macbook_pro\">MacBook Pro</h2>\r<br/>\nApple already refreshed the entry-level 14-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> with an M5 chip, but now it's time for the higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch models to get an update.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/m5-macbook-pro-purple.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031724\" />\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"design\">Design</h3>\r<br/>\nThere are no rumors of design changes, and we are expecting the upcoming M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models to look just like the M4 versions. Apple will continue to offer 14-inch and 16-inch size options, both of which should come in M5 Pro and M5 Max varieties.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"m5_max_and_m5_pro\">M5 Max and M5 Pro</h3>\r<br/>\nWe already got base model 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; with the new M5 chip in October, so what we're expecting are upgraded 14-inch and 16-inch models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe M5 family is built on a more advanced 3-nanometer process from TSMC, and it offers speed and efficiency improvements. The M5 chip is up to 20 percent faster in multi-core CPU performance than the M4 chip, and we could see similar improvements for the M5 Pro and M5 Max chip options. GPU performance is up to 30 percent faster.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith the M5, Apple added a Neural Accelerator to each GPU core, improving the speeds of GPU-based AI workloads. The chip also supports third-generation ray-tracing, second-generation dynamic caching, and enhanced shader cores.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe 16-core Neural Engine is more energy efficient than before, and unified memory bandwidth has improved. These are all features that we're likely to see with the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips as well.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"why_you_shouldnt_buy_an_m5_promax_macbook_pro\">Why You Shouldn't Buy an M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro</h3>\r<br/>\nIf you're not in serious need of a new &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; right away, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/10/macbook-pro-buying-advice-2026/\">early 2026 is a bad time to upgrade</a>. The next-generation &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; after the early 2026 models is expected to feature an OLED display and touchscreen capabilities, both of which will mark a major upgrade in display quality. It's expected to include a &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; instead of a notch, and macOS will be optimized for touch interactions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMost people shelling out extra money for a &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; with a higher-end M5 Pro or M5 Max chip need the extra performance or display quality, so it is worth waiting for the huge update that's coming.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe transition to OLED will also likely bring a design update along with M6 Pro and M6 Max chip technology, which is another reason to wait.\r<br/>\nOf course, the new features could be limited to higher-end &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models or could be significantly more expensive. If you're on a budget, need a Mac now, or don't care about OLED, the M5 Pro and Max models could still be worth considering.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"macbook_air\">MacBook Air</h2>\r<br/>\nAlong with the low-cost MacBook and M5 Pro/Max &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models, Apple could introduce a refreshed version of the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; next week.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/m4-macbook-air-purple.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003569\" />\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"m5_chip\">M5 Chip</h3>\r<br/>\nThe next-generation &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; will adopt the M5 chip, which Apple already introduced in the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models that came out last year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's M5 chip uses third-generation 3-nanometer technology, and it features up to a 10-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU with 3.5x faster performance than the M4 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe M5's multithreaded CPU performance is up to 15 percent faster than the M4, and it offers 30 percent faster GPU performance. Apple added a Neural Accelerator to each GPU core to improve the speeds of GPU-based AI workloads. Unified memory bandwidth is 153GB/s, which is close to a 30 percent improvement over the M4's memory bandwidth. Unified memory architecture lets the chip use a single memory pool for running AI models on device, boosting GPU performance, and improving multithreaded performance in apps, so an upgrade there is meaningful. RAM will continue to start at 16GB, with 24GB and 32GB available as upgrade options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThird-generation ray-tracing, second-generation dynamic caching, and upgraded shader cores bring improvements to gaming and other system-intensive tasks. An updated 16-core Neural Engine is more energy efficient than before, so we could see battery life improvements.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nStorage tiers are likely to stay the same, starting at 256GB with 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB available as upgrade options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"design\">Design</h3>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; got a design overhaul in 2022, and there are no signs that Apple is planning for an updated chassis in 2026. Apple often uses the same design for several years before updating, and design refreshes are usually tied to major new features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe're expecting Apple to release the same 13-inch and 15-inch size options in 2026. Both will feature the same aluminum unibody design and fanless thermal system, along with a Retina LCD display.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is likely to continue to offer two Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports, and the same speaker, microphone, and camera setup.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h3>\r<br/>\n&zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; pricing is not expected to change, and it should continue to start at &#36;1,099. There is a possibility that memory upgrades will be more expensive due to DRAM shortages that have driven prices up.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"other_possibilities\">Other Possibilities</h2>\r<br/>\nApple's Special Experience seems like it's going to focus primarily on lower-end devices, with the exception of the M5 Pro and M5 Max &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models. We are waiting on other devices that rumors have suggested will be refreshed in early 2026, but it's likely we'll be waiting a bit longer for them.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"homepod_mini\">HomePod mini</h3>\r<br/>\nA new version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> is apparently ready to go, but Apple may hold it back for a more home-focused refresh that will also include the rumored home hub. The home hub and the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; are likely tied to the new version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/yellow-homepod-mini-image.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-856947\" />\r<br/>\nApple was aiming to introduce the more capable &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; in iOS 26.4, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/ios-26-4-no-new-siri-features/\">pushed back Siri's debut</a> because of ongoing reliability issues. It's not clear when the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is coming now, and so the timing of the next &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is also unknown.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is expected to get a new chip and new colors, but not much else. The design will stay the same.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"apple_tv\">Apple TV</h3>\r<br/>\nAs with the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;, the next <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> is a device we've been hearing rumors about since late last year. It was supposed to come in late 2025 or early 2026, but it too is likely tied to the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; refresh.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Orange.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-869858\" />\r<br/>\nThere are no design changes expected for the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, and it will get an updated chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"macrumors_coverage\">MacRumors Coverage</h2>\r<br/>\nApple isn't holding an event for the new announcements, so there won't be a video to watch. We're expecting to see new products unveiled via press release on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, so stay tuned to <em>MacRumors</em> for details on everything Apple unveils.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/March-4-MacRumors-Logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036448\" />\r<br/>\nApple is holding a Special Experience for members of the media on March 4, 2026, where we're expecting Apple to show off the new products. <em>MacRumors</em> will be in attendance, so we'll be able to share a hands-on look at whatever Apple has to offer.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Special Experience will take place at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-products-march-2026/\">What to Expect From Apple&#039;s Big Week: iPhone 17e, Low-Cost MacBook, New iPads, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-apples-big-week-iphone-17e-low-cost-macbook-new-ipads-and-more.2478339/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "With a similar screen size and easy, one-handed grip, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> has always been the Apple device that overlaps most with dedicated e-readers. Now, amid <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/oled-ipad-mini-release-date-pricing-what-to-expect/\">rumors</a> pointing to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/28/apple-ipad-macbook-oled-displays/\">OLED display</a> for the next generation, could the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; finally replace devices such as the Kindle and Kobo?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ipad-mini-7-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-972160\" />\r<br/>\nThe shift from LCD to OLED could make the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; far more appealing as a reading device. OLED panels allow each pixel to turn off individually, producing true blacks and extremely high contrast.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nText can appear sharper and more defined against a dark background, particularly in dark mode. Night reading is also typically more comfortable because the display can emit less light overall. Color reproduction and viewing angles also improve with OLED, which could make a big difference for comics, magazines, and illustrated books.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnother benefit is power efficiency. OLED displays can consume less energy when displaying dark content. That could modestly extend battery life during reading sessions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAll current <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> models have no official water resistance rating. By contrast, devices like the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite and Kobo Libra Color are typically rated to withstand immersion, allowing users to read in the bath, by the pool, or at the beach without concern. Rumors suggest Apple is exploring a more sealed design for the next &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, potentially using vibration-based speakers and fewer ingress points <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/apple-plans-oled-for-ipad-mini-ipad-air-macbook-air-mini-water-resistance\">to add water resistance</a>. This could remove one of the everyday practical advantages that e-readers currently hold over the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHowever, dedicated e-readers would still retain some major advantages over the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;. Kindle and Kobo devices use e-ink screens that reflect ambient light rather than emitting light directly toward the eyes, behaving much more like paper. Many readers find that e-ink screens cause less fatigue during long reading sessions. Outdoor readability is another area where e-ink remains superior, since they become easier to read as ambient light increases.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBattery life is also dramatically different. Most e-readers last weeks on a single charge because the screen only uses power when the page changes. The &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; typically lasts for around a day or two of mixed use at most. E-readers are also intentionally limited devices that focus on reading, while tablets encourage multitasking, which can make focused reading more difficult for some users.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEven if OLED improves the reading experience, the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; would still compete in a different price category. The current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; starts at &#36;499, and rumors suggest the OLED version could cost up to &#36;100 more. By contrast, many Kindle and Kobo models are much more accessible and cost between &#36;110 and &#36;300 depending on features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOLED would still make the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; a significantly better reading device than it already is, but the physics of e-ink displays provide advantages that OLED cannot replicate, especially for reading. What OLED could do is shift the balance slightly; for casual readers, an OLED &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; may become good enough that buying a separate e-reader no longer feels necessary.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe OLED &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is expected to launch with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/ipad-mini-a19-pro-chip/\">A19 Pro</a> chip in the <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5143897135/QfDAZ44qp\">second half of 2026</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/27/oled-ipad-mini-kindle-killer/\">Could Apple&#039;s OLED iPad Mini Finally Be a Kindle Killer?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/could-apples-oled-ipad-mini-finally-be-a-kindle-killer.2478325/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0G6GRGCLW\">Astropad</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> and an <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0G6GRGCLW\">anti-reflective Fresh Coat screen protector</a> from Astropad to go along with it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030682\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-main.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br/>\nFresh Coat is a screen protector that Astropad created with an optical-grade anti-reflective coating to reduce glare and provide a better <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> viewing experience. The technology cuts reflections by 75 percent, while improving contrast and keeping colors vibrant. Unlike other anti-reflective screen protectors on the market, Fresh Coat adds no haze or distortion to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030688\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-comparison-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0G6GRGCLW\">Priced at &#36;30</a>, Fresh Coat is made from a scratch-proof tempered glass that provides protection for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display in addition to cutting down on glare and reflections. It's slim and doesn't add bulk to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; even though there are five layers of protective technology at work. From the top down, there's an anti-reflective coating, an oleophobic and hydrophobic coating, a layer of tempered glass, a dust barrier, and an impact-resistant \"airbag\" bonding.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030684\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-layers.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br/>\nIf you have an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, it comes with an anti-reflective coating added by Apple. What you might not know is that you can't use just any screen protector with the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;. If you put a regular screen protector without an anti-reflective coating on, it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/04/iphone-17-screen-protector-anti-reflective-issue/\">nullifies</a> the anti-reflective properties of that added coating.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1035468\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/fresh-coat-astropad-chart.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1839\" height=\"1153\" />\r<br/>\nSince Fresh Coat has its own anti-reflective coating, it improves on Apple's included anti-reflective layer, reducing glare even further. With Fresh Coat, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s screen is easy to see in any lighting conditions, there's less eye strain, and if you use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/\">Dark Mode</a>, it looks even darker.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030686\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-description.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br/>\nIf you don't have an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, Fresh Coat can provide an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17-style display upgrade, mirroring Apple's own reflection-reducing display coating. Fresh Coat is available for all &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> Pro and Pro Max, and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 15 Pro and Pro Max.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030687\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-comparison-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br/>\nAstropad designed an installation process that's impossible to mess up, so you get perfect alignment on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; without the hassle that comes with most screen protectors.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe have an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; in white and a <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0G6GRGCLW\">Fresh Coat screen protector</a> for one lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader.

      "content": "<em>Macworld</em>'s Filipe Espósito today again <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3073401/apple-testing-a-studio-display-with-high-end-ports-and-speakers.html\">reported</a> that Apple appears to be developing two new Studio Display models with different specs.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/Apple-Studio-Display-Magic-Trackpad-Keyboard-Mouse.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-838980\" />\r<br/>\nBased on lines of code in \"internal Apple files,\" which likely refers to a macOS Tahoe Kernel Debug Kit that leaked online last year, Espósito continues to believe that both of the new Studio Display models will feature ProMotion, enabling up to a 120Hz refresh rate, as well as HDR support for increased brightness and dynamic range.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor the higher-end Studio Display, the report has revealed two more potential upgrades that had yet to be rumored until now, including superior speakers and more and/or higher-spec ports. Apple says the current Studio Display has a \"high-fidelity six-speaker system\" that supports Spatial Audio, and the monitor has one Thunderbolt 3 port that connects to and charges a Mac, and three USB-C ports for connecting accessories.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe new Studio Display will likely feature at least one Thunderbolt 5 port, to ensure there is enough bandwidth for both 5K resolution at 120Hz and accessories. However, another leaker curiously claimed that at least one of the new Studio Display models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/apple-studio-display-2-unusual-feature-rumor/\">will max out at 90Hz</a>, so we will have to see which of these rumors is accurate. A boost to the current 60Hz refresh rate can make videos and scrolling look smoother to the eye.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEspósito said that the higher-end Studio Display could have a 32-inch screen, whereas the lower-end model would likely stick with a 27-inch screen. However, this particular claim was merely speculation, rather than info from the internal Apple files. Keep in mind that with a 32-inch screen, 5K resolution would not be Retina quality, so the resolution would have to increase to 6K like on Apple's higher-end Pro Display XDR.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDisplay industry expert Ross Young previously said that at least one new Studio Display <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/\">would feature mini-LED backlighting</a>. If so, perhaps Apple will opt to discontinue its Pro Display XDR with full-array LED backlighting and instead offer both lower-end and higher-end Studio Display configurations. But again, this is just speculation.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnother previously-rumored feature for at least one of the new Studio Display models is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/\">an A19</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/a19-pro-chip-coming-to-studio-display-2/\">A19 Pro chip</a>, up from the A13 Bionic chip in the current model. This would contribute to improved performance, camera enhancements, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAltogether, the full set of Studio Display upgrades could include a higher 120Hz refresh rate, HDR support for increased brightness and contrast ratio, improved speakers, Thunderbolt 5 support, mini-LED backlighting, a newer A19 or A19 Pro chip for performance and camera enhancements, and hopefully a larger 32-inch screen.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/09/apple-studio-display-2-latest-rumors/\">No major design changes</a> are expected.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple reportedly plans to release the new Studio Display models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/03/apple-studio-display-2-rumored-features/\">in the first half of 2026</a>. The current Studio Display launched in March 2022, alongside the first Mac Studio, so there has been a long wait for a refresh. With a new Apple monitor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/15/new-studio-display-or-pro-display-xdr-filing/\">surfacing in a regulatory database</a> last month, a launch should finally be getting close.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/\">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macworld-com/\">Macworld</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77\">Mac Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/27/two-more-studio-display-2-rumors/\">Two More Studio Display 2 Upgrades Leaked in New Report</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/two-more-studio-display-2-upgrades-leaked-in-new-report.2478309/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

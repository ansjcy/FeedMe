This is something Apple has always advocated for.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCook said he had a \"good conversation\" with U.S. President Donald Trump this week, in which he shared his views, but he did not elaborate.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHere is Cook's full memo to Apple employees, per <em>Bloomberg</em>:<blockquote>Team,\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI’m heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis, and my prayers and deepest sympathies are with the families, with the communities, and with everyone that’s been affected.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis is a time for deescalation. I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they’re from, and when we embrace our shared humanity. This is something Apple has always advocated for. I had a good conversation with the president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI know this is very emotional and challenging for so many. I am proud of how deeply our teams care about the world beyond our walls. That empathy is one of Apple’s greatest strengths and it is something I believe we all cherish.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThank you for all that you do.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTim</blockquote>Cook was not specific, but he appears to be responding to the killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Pretti was fatally shot by U.S. federal immigration agents following an encounter in Minneapolis on Saturday. The incident has stoked public outcry in the country.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n37-year-old poet Renée Good was also shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in Minneapolis on January 7.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCook was criticized by some for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/tim-cook-melania-documentary-screening/\">attending a private screening</a> of the upcoming documentary film \"Melania\" at the White House on Saturday, just hours after Pretti was killed. Critics said that it was poor timing for Cook to attend the VIP gathering, given the events that had transpired in Minneapolis earlier in the day.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCook has maintained a working relationship with President Trump, and last year he gave him a gift containing a 24-karat pure gold bar.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/27/tim-cook-responds-after-minneapolis-shootings/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook Responds After ICE Shootings in Minneapolis</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-responds-after-ice-shootings-in-minneapolis.2476761/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "DRAM shortages are set to impact smartphone manufacturers like Apple in 2026, but the company is going to try to keep <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/\">iPhone 18</a> prices steady despite having to pay more for components, according to <a href=\"https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/2016213691075862869\">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/iphone-17-cyber.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028589\" />\r<br/>\nKuo says that Apple negotiates memory prices with suppliers on a quarterly basis, so price increases are expected in the second quarter of 2026. The upcoming price hike will be similar to the first quarter increase that has already seen Apple paying more for memory. Estimates suggest that prices are up 10 to 25 percent <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/apple-to-weather-dram-price-surge/\">compared to last year</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe higher memory cost will impact the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s gross margins, but Apple is in a position to establish deals to get a steady supply, and it is able to absorb some of the increased cost. From Kuo:\r<br/>\n<blockquote>For most non-AI brands, even if you're willing to pay up, there's no guarantee you'll get the supply. The fact that Apple can lock in a deal like this shows just how much leverage they have.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHigher memory costs will hit iPhone gross margins. But Apple's playbook is clear: use the market chaos to their advantage--secure the chips, absorb the costs, and grab more market share. They'll make it back later on the services side.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nApple may need to address memory price increases during the January 30 earnings call covering the first fiscal quarter of 2026 (October to December 2025). Kuo expects that Apple will avoid raising prices \"as much as possible,\" and that at least the starting price of the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; models will be flat.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple has previously absorbed component costs, and was able to keep <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> pricing relatively steady. The base &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; model did not go up in price and still starts at &#36;799, though Apple did start charging &#36;100 more for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a> because of the new 256GB minimum storage.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nComponents other than memory could also be in short supply in the coming months, leading to further supply chain issues that could force price increases. LPDDR and NAND are currently facing shortages and higher prices because of demand from the AI industry. Chip manufacturers are prioritizing advanced memory for AI servers over the memory used in smartphones, and there has been speculation that the memory price increase will cause smartphone costs to rise across multiple brands.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/\">iPhone 18</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/27/apple-iphone-18-starting-price-steady/\">Apple to Keep iPhone 18 Starting Price Steady Despite Rising Memory Costs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-keep-iphone-18-starting-price-steady-despite-rising-memory-costs.2476738/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

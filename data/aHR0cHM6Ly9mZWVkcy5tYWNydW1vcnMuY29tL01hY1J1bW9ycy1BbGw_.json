      "content": "Apple today updated its <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/leadership/\">executive leadership page</a> to remove John Giannandrea, who is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/apple-ai-chief-retiring-after-siri-failure/\">set to retire</a> from Apple next spring. Earlier this week, Apple said that Giannandrea would step down from his role as AI chief, serving as an advisor until he leaves the company.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/hey-siri-banner-apple.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-840591\" />\r<br/>\nGiannandrea's upcoming retirement was announced on Monday, and Apple wasted no time updating its leadership website. Former Microsoft Corporate VP of AI Amar Subramanya is set to take over as Apple's vice president of AI, but he is not yet listed on the site. Subramanya will report to software engineering chief Craig Federighi.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSome of the teams that Giannandrea led are being shifted to Sabih Khan and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/\">Eddy Cue</a>, including AI Infrastructure and Search and Knowledge.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGiannandrea joined Apple in 2018 as the company's senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy. He was overseeing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, Core ML, and other AI efforts at Apple. Before Apple, Giannandrea worked at Google as a senior vice president of engineering.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAfter the iOS 18 &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; failure, Giannandrea's retirement comes as no surprise. Apple announced new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features at WWDC when it unveiled iOS 18, and then used those unreleased features to market the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models. In spring 2025, when we were expecting the launch of the promised functionality, Apple said the smarter version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; wasn't ready and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/\">announced a year-long delay</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMore than half a dozen former employees who worked on Apple's AI team <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/chaos-behind-siri-revealed/\">told <em>The Information</em></a> the issues with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; stemmed from poor leadership, stringent privacy practices, conflicting personalities, and indecision. Apple hasn't publicly commented on the situation, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/siri-leadership-shakeup/\">stripped Siri</a> from Giannandrea in March and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/siri-management-team-overhaul/\">overhauled the Siri team</a>. Apple also removed Giannandrea from its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/apple-robotics-team-leadership-change/\">robotics division</a> in April.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/john-giannandrea/\">John Giannandrea</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/apple-removes-giannandrea-executive-page/\">Apple Removes Former AI Chief John Giannandrea From Executive Leadership Page</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-removes-former-ai-chief-john-giannandrea-from-executive-leadership-page.2474191/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg today announced plans to launch a creative studio that will be led by former Apple UI designer Alan Dye. As we learned earlier today, Dye <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/apple-alan-dye-joining-meta/\">is leaving his position</a> as Vice President of Human Interface Design at Apple to become Meta's new chief design officer.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/meta-ray-bans-feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1724\" height=\"970\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001011\" />\r<br/>\nIn a post on <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DR0Wsy0EhCP\">social media site Threads</a>, Zuckerberg said that Meta's creative studio will merge design, fashion, and technology, while also treating intelligence as a \"new design material.\"\r<br/>\n<blockquote>The new studio will bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences. Our idea is to treat intelligence as a new design material and imagine what becomes possible when it is abundant, capable, and human-centered. We plan to elevate design within Meta, and pull together a talented group with a combination of craft, creative vision, systems thinking, and deep experience building iconic products that bridge hardware and software.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe're entering a new era where AI glasses and other devices will change how we connect with technology and each other. The potential is enormous, but what matters most is making these experiences feel natural and truly centered around people. With this new studio, we're focused on making every interaction thoughtful, intuitive, and built to serve people.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nMeta is also hiring another Apple designer, Billy Sorrentino, who has been on Apple's human interface design team for the last 10 years. Like Dye, Sorrentino worked on Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a> Liquid Glass redesign.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlong with the two former Apple designers, Meta's studio will include its existing industrial design team and its metaverse design and art teams.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMeta currently sells its Quest VR headsets and AI smart glasses designed in collaboration with Ray-Ban and Oakley. Meta is aiming to expand further into hardware, and it is hard at work on a set of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/25/meta-augmented-reality-glasses/\">augmented reality glasses</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlan Dye was one of Apple's few remaining designers that worked alongside Jony Ive. He originally joined Apple in 2006, transitioning to Ive's team in 2012 to work on iOS 7. He has been leading Apple's user interface design team since 2015, and will now start at Meta on December 31.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/\">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/meta-creative-studio-announced/\">Meta&#039;s Creative Studio Led by Former Apple Design Head to &#039;Treat Intelligence as a New Design Material&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/metas-creative-studio-led-by-former-apple-design-head-to-treat-intelligence-as-a-new-design-material.2474189/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Just before Apple updated the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> with a next-generation M5 chip, Samsung refreshed its tablet lineup and debuted the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra. We thought we'd pit Apple's latest &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; against Samsung's newest tablet to see how they compare to one another.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe title=\"M5 iPad Pro vs Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra — A Surprising Winner?\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G-GTZ2thJv8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br/>\nWhile the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; measures in at 13 inches, the S11 Ultra is much larger at 14.6 inches. They both have OLED displays, but the bigger screen makes an impact. Samsung's screen is bright, colorful, and has excellent contrast, plus you don't have to pay extra for a matte coating to cut down on glare.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe M5 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and the S11 Ultra are both 5.1mm, so they're incredibly thin and light. That's especially apparent with the bigger screen.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple doesn't let you upgrade &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; storage on your own, but the S11 Ultra has a microSD card slot that accommodates up to 2TB of storage. RAM is up to 16GB, the same as the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBoth tablets have a stylus accessory, but Samsung includes its S Pen in the box while Apple sells the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> Pro separately. This year's S Pen has a pencil like feel and a new tip that provides a better writing experience, but the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is still better.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSamsung's tablets have a DeX mode that allows them to connect to a display or a TV for a desktop-like usage experience. DeX transforms the UI and optimizes it for a larger screen so you can do more on your tablet with dual-screen support. You can connect a second display to your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, but the experience is nothing like DeX, and you're limited to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; multitasking features. Samsung's S11 Ultra is much better at transitioning from a tablet to something more closely resembling a computer.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSamsung devices run Android, which is an immediate dealbreaker for a lot of Apple users. Android has the benefit of deep AI integration that Apple currently can't match, so the S11 Ultra has features like Drawing Assist, Writing Assist, camera-supported Gemini Live, and full Gemini support.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has no water resistance, but the S11 Ultra offers IP68 protection, which means it can hold up to submersion in water. The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; wins in sheer performance thanks to the M5 chip. Samsung has a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/\">3nm</a> MediaTek Dimensity 9400+ chip, but the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is almost twice as fast in most benchmarking tests.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> is still more robust with a better selection of apps optimized for a tablet-sized screen, and there are many pro-level apps that aren't available on Samsung's platform. Both Apple and Samsung make keyboard cases for their tablets, but Samsung's S11 Ultra keyboard doesn't have a trackpad, which is a major downgrade compared to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s Magic Keyboard.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWould you get a Samsung tablet?

It uses the accelerometer to monitor subtle wrist movements that are associated with interruptions in normal breathing patterns, alerting users if breathing disturbances are detected. Sleep apnea detection also requires 30 days of data, with information available in the Breathing Disturbances section of the Health app.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHearing Test and Hearing Aid functionality first rolled out last year, allowing the AirPods Pro 2 and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/\">AirPods Pro 3</a> to be used in lieu of hearing aids for individuals with mild to moderate hearing loss. The hearing test uses tones at different frequencies to detect hearing loss, and if issues are detected, users can turn on hearing assistance. The feature also includes Loud Sound Reduction to protect hearing health.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nConversation Boost has long been an AirPods Pro feature, but the auto-on option paired with Hearing Aid functionality automatically enhances sound volume when someone speaks.

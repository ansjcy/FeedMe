It is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/30/apple-in-february-2026-preview/\">expected to be part of iOS 26.4</a>, which should enter beta testing in February and be released to the general public in March or April.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBack in June 2024, Apple said the revamped Siri will have understanding of personal context, on-screen awareness, deeper in-app controls, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSecond, Siri will reportedly get even better on iOS 27, as Apple is said to be planning to turn the assistant <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/siri-chatbot-ios-27/\">into a full-out chatbot</a>, allowing users to have sustained, back-and-forth conversations with the assistant. This will essentially turn Siri into ChatGPT or Gemini, except it will be built right into the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, with no app required.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGurman said the Siri chatbot will be \"competitive with Gemini 3,\" and \"significantly more capable\" than the more personalized Siri coming with iOS 26.4.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe high-ranking Siri executive who left Apple was Stuart Bowers, according to the report, which described him as \"one of the company's most senior executives working on Siri.\" He joined Google's artificial intelligence research laboratory DeepMind.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe four researchers who left are Yinfei Yang, Haoxuan You, Bailin Wang, and Zirui Wang. <div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/30/apple-loses-more-ai-researchers/\">Apple Still Preparing Two New Versions of Siri as Some Employees Leave</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-still-preparing-two-new-versions-of-siri-as-some-employees-leave.2476922/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

We expect the iOS 26.3 Release Candidate to be seeded as early as next week, and the update should be released to the general public <strong>in the first half of February</strong>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\niOS 26.3 is a relatively minor update, with only a handful of notable new features, including a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/ios-26-3-iphone-android-transfer-tool/\">new iOS-to-Android transfer tool</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/ios-26-3-notification-forwarding/\">notification forwarding</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/22/ios-26-3-dma-airpods-pairing/\">AirPods-like proximity pairing</a> for third-party accessories like smartwatches, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/ios-26-3-limit-precise-location/\">carrier-related limit precise location setting</a>. Apple also appears to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/ios-26-rcs-3-future-benefits/\">laying the groundwork</a> for carriers to begin supporting end-to-end encryption for RCS messaging, which it has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/14/apple-encrypted-rcs-messaging-software-update/\">promised to implement</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Personalized Siri (Beta)</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/siri-gemini-iphone.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032574\" />\r<br/>\nApple plans to announce a more personalized version of Siri <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/google-gemini-next-generation-siri/\">powered by Google Gemini</a> <strong>in the second half of February</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-25/inside-apple-s-ai-shake-up-ai-safari-and-plans-for-new-siri-in-ios-26-4-ios-27-mktqy7xb\">according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe more personalized Siri will be part of iOS 26.4, which will be available in beta in February and released to the general public in March or early April, according to Gurman. Based on that timeframe, the new-and-improved Siri should be available to all customers with an iPhone 15 Pro or newer in just a few more months.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs previewed by Apple, the assistant \"should be able to tap into personal data and on-screen content to fulfill tasks,\" according to Gurman.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple first announced the more personalized version of Siri all the way back at WWDC 2024, but it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/\">eventually delayed</a>. At the time, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info retrieved from the Mail and Messages apps, as one example of a new capability.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe revamped Siri reportedly experienced issues inside Apple, leading the company <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/google-gemini-future-apple-intelligence-features/\">to turn to Google Gemini</a>. As part of the partnership, the revamped Siri will still run on a new Apple Intelligence model that has Gemini's technology baked in.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Other Known Dates</h2><ul><li><strong>Thursday, February 5:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/14/apple-arcade-games-february-2026/\">Another four games are coming to Apple Arcade</a>, including Retrocade, an app that lets you play classic arcade games like Asteroids, PAC-MAN, Breakout, Galaga, and Space Invaders.

They have never been made available through Apple's online store or physical retail locations.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"<a href=\"https://appleunsold.com\">AppleUnsold</a>\" surfaced this week as an Australia-based seller that has begun offering &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; display hardware for sale through both an independent website and an eBay storefront. From company's website:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<blockquote>AppleUnsold exists because too many people were asking the same question: \"Where can I buy that?\" The store display stands, retail accessories, Genius Bar tools and employee gear, and until now, the answer was always the same: you can't. Despite large demand, Apple simply won't sell them. That's where we come in. Display models, store exclusives and Apple-only equipment are exactly what we specialise in.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe give you access to products you simply can't find anywhere else. Every item is genuine Apple, carefully inspected and graded before listing.</blockquote>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nItems currently offered or previously listed for sale include <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; demo chargers, Apple Watch charging docks, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a> display stands, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> trays, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> ring stands, and display trays designed for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>. The catalog also extends beyond presentation hardware to include diagnostic cables and service-related accessories, such as Apple Watch restore docks and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> debugging cables, which are typically reserved for &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; back-of-house use or authorized service environments.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAppleUnsold says on its website that all items are genuine Apple products and that inventory consists of both new and used hardware. The company also notes that supply is limited and dependent on availability, with many items frequently selling out.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe seller originally operated exclusively through eBay and continues to maintain a presence there alongside its standalone storefront. The AppleUnsold eBay account shows a 100% positive feedback rating based on a limited number of completed transactions. Customer feedback on specific listings includes confirmations that purchased items appear to be authentic Apple hardware.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's retail fixtures and internal tools are not authorized for consumer resale, and the company treats such hardware as proprietary retail property. Historically, Apple has taken action to restrict unauthorized sales of internal-use products, and it is not clear where AppleUnsold is sourcing stock from or how its business model works. <div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/retail/\">Retail</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/30/retail-accessories-now-available/\">Retail Accessories Apple Won&#039;t Sell You Now Available via New Site</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/retail-accessories-apple-wont-sell-you-now-available-via-new-site.2476910/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "On this week's episode of <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-launches-airtag-2-and-apple-creator-studio/id1602394741?i=1000747360468\">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss Apple's newly launched <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airtag/\">AirTag</a> 2 and Apple Creator Studio.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dzpMIzZ6XZQ?si=oSwAP7YDyXMyVEDZ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div>\r<br/>\nEarlier this week, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-announces-new-airtag/\">announced</a> the second-generation &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj;, marking the first major update to its item tracker since the product's introduction in 2021, with improvements focused on tracking range, audio output, and device support rather than changes to its physical design.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe new &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; uses a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip that extends Precision Finding range by up to 50%, adds support for Precision Finding on compatible Apple Watch models for the first time, and includes an upgraded Bluetooth specification designed to improve general tracking range. Apple also says the built-in speaker is up to 50% louder, making it easier to locate items in noisy environments.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtag-1-vs-airtag-2/\">AirTag 1 vs. AirTag 2 Buyer's Guide: All 15+ Differences Compared</a></li></ul>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nExternally, the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; remains visually similar to the original and continues to use a replaceable CR2032 coin battery with more than a year of battery life, while Apple has made a significant number of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/28/airtag-2-full-of-hidden-changes/\">internal changes</a>. The second-generation &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; is priced the same as before at &#36;29 for a single unit or &#36;99 for a four-pack, is compatible with existing &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; accessories, and requires devices running iOS 26.2.1 or later.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/28/apple-creator-studio-now-available/\">launched Creator Studio</a>, a new all-in-one subscription aimed at content creators. For &#36;12.99 per month, or &#36;129 per year, Creator Studio provides access to Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage, consolidating tools for video editing, music production, image editing, and live performance. The bundle replaces Apple's long-standing one-time purchase model for these apps with a subscription approach, while keeping standalone versions available for users who do not want access to the full package.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBeyond bundling existing apps, Creator Studio introduces a set of AI-powered features that are exclusive to subscribers. These include transcript and visual search in Final Cut Pro, enhanced beat detection and new dynamic titles, AI-assisted session players and harmonic analysis in Logic Pro, and new design and warp tools in Pixelmator Pro, which is now available on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> for the first time. The subscription also unlocks premium AI features in Apple's free productivity apps, including Keynote, Pages, and Numbers, with Freeform support coming later.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCreator Studio is available now via the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, with a one-month free trial for all users and a three-month trial for customers who purchase a qualifying new Mac or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. The subscription supports Family Sharing for up to six people, and features discounted pricing for students and educators.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow\">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1\"><div class=\"fancybutton\">Subscribe to <em>The MacRumors Show</em> YouTube channel!</div></a></div>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYou can also listen to &zwnj;The MacRumors Show&zwnj;

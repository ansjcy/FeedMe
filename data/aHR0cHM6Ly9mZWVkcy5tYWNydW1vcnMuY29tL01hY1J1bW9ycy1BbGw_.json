      "content": "Apple is in talks with major Indian banks as it prepares to introduce Apple Pay in the country sometime in the middle of 2026, reports <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-26/apple-in-talks-with-banks-to-start-payment-service-in-india\">Bloomberg</a></em>. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-pay-feature-dynamic-island.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-921515\" />\r<br/>\nApple is said to be in discussions with ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Axis Bank, according to people with knowledge of the matter who spoke to the publication. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe report corroborates a story in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/apple-pay-launch-india-this-year/\">January</a> by <em>Business Standard</em> that said Apple Pay was preparing to go live in the Indian market before the end of the year. <em>The Times of India</em> also earlier reported the India plans for Apple Pay.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nToday's report says Apple is talking through the plan with global payment networks Mastercard and Visa. UPI dominates digital payments in India, and Apple Pay is expected to support the state-backed payments interface, which allows customers to instantly transfer money and bills.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple Pay launched <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/17/apple-celebrates-10-years-of-apple-pay/\">more than 10 years ago</a>, and is already available across 89 markets globally. Late last year, India's central bank approved new rules that allow biometric authentication like Touch ID and Face ID for digital payments. The country's authentication methods previously relied on one-time passwords sent over SMS messages.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe timing comes at a good moment for Apple in India. The company recorded its highest quarterly shipments in the country during Q3 2025, reaching 5 million units and securing fourth place in the market for the first time, according to IDC data. Apple is also rapidly expanding its retail presence in India, with a sixth store opening in Mumbai on Thursday.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/\">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/26/apple-launch-apple-pay-india-this-year/\">Apple in Talks With Banks to Launch Apple Pay in India This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-in-talks-with-banks-to-launch-apple-pay-in-india-this-year.2478247/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple is working on a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> that could launch next week ahead of the \"Special Experience\" planned for March 4, so we thought we'd highlight all of the rumors about the device so far.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-937842\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/macbook-pro-blue.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1607\" height=\"905\" />\r<br/>\n<h2>Design</h2>\r<br/>\nThere are no rumors of design changes, and we are expecting the upcoming M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models to look just like the M4 versions. Apple will continue to offer 14-inch and 16-inch size options, both of which should come in M5 Pro and M5 Max varieties.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>M5 Max and M5 Pro Chip</h2>\r<br/>\nWe already got the base model 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; with the new M5 chip in October, so what we're expecting are upgraded 14-inch and 16-inch models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe M5 family is built on a more advanced N3P 3-nanometer process from TSMC, and it offers speed and efficiency improvements. The M5 chip is up to 20 percent faster in multi-core CPU performance than the M4 chip, and we could see similar improvements for the M5 Pro and M5 Max chip options. GPU performance is up to 30 percent faster.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith the M5, Apple added a Neural Accelerator to each GPU core, improving the speeds of GPU-based AI workloads. The chip also supports third-generation ray-tracing, second-generation dynamic caching, and enhanced shader cores. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe 16-core Neural Engine is more energy efficient than before, and unified memory bandwidth has improved significantly. These are all features that we're likely to see with the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips as well.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Other Possible Updates</h2>\r<br/>\nWe haven't heard rumors about any other features coming to the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; line. Apple did update SSD speeds for the M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models, so we could see the same upgrade to the M5 Pro and M5 Max machines.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Why You Shouldn't Buy an M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro</h2>\r<br/>\nIf you're not in serious need of a new &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; right away, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/10/macbook-pro-buying-advice-2026/\">early 2026 is a bad time to upgrade</a>. The next-generation &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; after the early 2026 models is expected to feature an OLED display and touchscreen capabilities, both of which will mark a major upgrade in display quality. It's expected to include a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a> instead of a notch, and macOS will be optimized for touch interactions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMost people shelling out extra money for a &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; with a higher-end M5 Pro or M5 Max chip need the extra performance or display quality, so it is worth waiting for the huge update that's coming.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe transition to OLED will also likely bring a design update along with M6 Pro and M6 Max chip technology, which is another reason to wait.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOf course, the new features could be limited to higher-end &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models or could be significantly more expensive. If you're on a budget, need a Mac now, or don't care about OLED, the M5 Pro and Max models could still be worth considering.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Launch Date</h2>\r<br/>\nThe new &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models could be announced via press release next week ahead of Apple's Special Experience.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">MacBook Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/25/m5-pro-max-macbook-pro-rumors/\">M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro: What to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m5-pro-and-m5-max-macbook-pro-what-to-expect.2478235/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "macOS 27 is still months away, but there are already a handful of rumors about the upcoming software update, as outlined below.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/macOS-27-Feature-Blue.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1037586\" />\r<br/>\nWe expect the first beta of macOS 27 to be seeded to developers during WWDC 2026 in June, and a public beta to follow in July. Following beta testing, the update should be released to all users with a compatible Mac in September.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nmacOS 26 is known as macOS Tahoe, but the name of macOS 27 has yet to leak.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Siri Upgrades</h2>\r<br/>\nmacOS 27 will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/siri-chatbot-ios-27/\">reportedly include a full-out Siri chatbot</a> that you can have back-and-forth conversations with. This would make Siri more like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/siri-features-delayed-ios-26-4/\">Due to delays</a>, macOS 27 might also include at least some of the personalized Siri features that Apple previewed all the way back at WWDC 2024.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor example, Apple showed a user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation based on info retrieved from the Mail and Messages apps. This functionality was previewed on an iPhone, but it will extend to the iPad and Mac.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>More Apple Intelligence Features</h2>\r<br/>\nLast month, Apple and Google announced that Google Gemini <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/google-gemini-future-apple-intelligence-features/\">will help power future Apple Intelligence features</a>, and that will extend beyond the more personalized version of Siri. However, exactly which features arrive remains to be seen.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Touch Interface</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/macOS-Liquid-Glass-Icon.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1037592\" />\r<br/>\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman this week reported that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/24/touchscreen-macbook-pro-dynamic-island/\">preparing a touch-optimized version of macOS</a> for the rumored MacBook Pro with a touch screen.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor example, if a user touches a button or control on the screen, the report said a relevant set of commands will instantly appear in a menu surrounding their finger. And if a user taps on an item in the menu bar at the top of the screen, the report said the controls will enlarge so they are easier to select with a finger.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGurman expects the MacBook Pro with a touch screen to be released in late 2026, so these touch optimizations will presumably arrive in macOS 27. However, the changes might be hidden until the touch-screen MacBook Pro launches.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Improved Stability</h2>\r<br/>\nmacOS 27 will reportedly be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/23/ios-27-two-key-upgrades/\">similar to 2009's Mac OS X Snow Leopard</a>, in the sense that Apple is apparently very focused on improving \"quality and underlying performance.\" Apple is expected to implement many bug fixes and stability improvements, and there may also be some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/macos-tahoe-finder-bug-slipping-ui-polish/\">much-needed</a> Liquid Glass design enhancements.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>No Intel Macs</h2>\r<br/>\nLast year, Apple announced that macOS Tahoe would be the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/intel-macs-no-more-updates/\">final major macOS release for Intel-based Macs</a>, meaning that macOS 27 will be compatible with Apple silicon Macs with the M1 chip and newer only. However, Apple will likely continue to release security fixes for some Intel-based Macs for at least a few more years.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macos-27/\">macOS 27</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/25/macos-27-all-the-rumors-so-far/\">macOS 27: All the Rumors So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-27-all-the-rumors-so-far.2478230/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Samsung's latest devices are focused on AI, and Samsung says they have the most \"intuitive, proactive, and adaptive Galaxy AI features\" to date.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe title=\"S26 Ultra First Look\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKrAbgEPVmA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br/>\nThe 6.3-inch <a href=\"https://howl.link/5y8v9ddguwbhk\">Galaxy S26</a> is Samsung's smallest and most affordable smartphone, followed by the 6.7-inch <a href=\"https://howl.link/6utx9j1c58ksn\">Galaxy S26+</a>. The 6.9-inch <a href=\"https://howl.link/pzy7qx3e5w8zh\">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a> is the high-end model. All three devices feature OLED displays, but only the Ultra works with the S Pen stylus.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/samsung-s26-ultra-home.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1037523\" />\r<br/>\nNew to the Galaxy S26 Ultra is a built-in \"Privacy Display\" that makes it harder to view what's on the screen when looking at the phone from a side angle. It's clear when looking at it head on, but someone sitting next to you will have a hard time seeing your phone's display. Privacy Display works at the pixel level, controlling how pixels disperse light. It can be set to activate only for certain apps or situations like entering a PIN, and there are partial and maximum privacy options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/samsung-s26-ultra-privacy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1037520\" />\r<br/>\nSamsung's Galaxy S26 Ultra has the best camera lineup, featuring a 200-megapixel wide lens, a 50-megapixel ultra wide lens, and two telephoto lenses. The 10-megapixel telephoto lens has 3x optical zoom, while the 50-megapixel telephoto lens features 5x optical zoom and 10x \"optical quality\" zoom.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere's a new Nightography feature for clearer video in low lighting conditions, and several AI photo features. Photo Assist lets users describe the change they want to make to a photo, from restoring missing elements to removing objects. It can also change a photo from day to night, or change a person's outfit.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCreative Studio uses sketches, photos, or prompts to create and edit AI-generated visuals like stickers, wallpapers, and invitations.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/samsung-s26-ultra-hand.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1037522\" />\r<br/>\nThe smartphones use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, which Samsung says is 19 percent faster than the prior-generation CPU in the Ultra. The GPU is 24 percent faster, and there's a 39 percent improvement in neural processing. The Ultra model also includes an updated vapor chamber with thermal material at the sides of the processor to better dissipate heat. Samsung says the processor also includes a \"ProScaler\" feature that improves image scaling for photos and videos.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMost models feature 12GB RAM, though the 1TB Ultra model has 16GB. Samsung added faster charging, and the device is able to charge to 75 percent in 30 minutes. Wireless charging at up to 25W is supported.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/samsung-s26-ultra-rear.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1037521\" />\r<br/>\nAlong with the previously mentioned photo editing AI features, there are several other AI additions.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Now Nudge</strong> - Now Nudge offers suggestions to help users avoid distractions. If someone asks for photos from a recent event, the Galaxy S26 can automatically suggest them so there's no need to switch apps and search for them.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Now Brief</strong> - Samsung's daily AI-powered briefing is more proactive and more personalized, and it is able to surface reminders for important events based on personal context.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Circle to Search</strong> - Circle to Search supports improved multi-object recognition so it can identify and locate multiple items in an image.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Call Screening</strong> - Call screening detects unknown callers and asks them why they called, summarizing the information.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Privacy Alerts</strong> - Machine learning notifies users when apps with device admin privileges unnecessarily try to access sensitive data.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Private Album</strong> - With private album, users can hide select photos and videos without creating a separate folder or signing into a Samsung account.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Bixby</strong> - Bixby serves as a conversational device agent that can adjust settings or help users with troubleshooting.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Other chatbots</strong> - Galaxy users can choose other chatbots like Gemini and Perplexity, which can be activated with a button press or voice prompt.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Background processing</strong> - The Galaxy S26 series can handle multi-step tasks in the background, which allows AI agents to complete tasks while the user does something else.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nSamsung also introduced the <a href=\"https://howl.link/jk0uzh09swdzi\">Galaxy Buds4 and Buds4 Pro</a>, which are designed to be used with the Galaxy S26 devices. The Galaxy Buds4 earbuds feature an updated fit and improved sound quality. The Buds4 Pro include Active Noise Cancellation, upgraded Adaptive EQ, an option for accepting or declining calls with head gestures, and support for activating AI agents.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPre-orders for the new Samsung smartphones are available starting today, with a launch to follow on March 11. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/5y8v9ddguwbhk\">Galaxy S26</a> starts at &#36;899.99, the <a href=\"https://howl.link/6utx9j1c58ksn\">Galaxy S26+</a> starts at &#36;1,099.99, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/pzy7qx3e5w8zh\">the Galaxy S26 Ultra</a> starts at &#36;1,299.99. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/jk0uzh09swdzi\">Galaxy Buds4</a> are also available for pre-order starting today.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<small><em>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Samsung.

      "content": "Apple is expected to unveil its long-rumored lower-cost MacBook <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/22/five-new-apple-products-next-week/\">next week</a>. Given it will be more affordable, this MacBook model will obviously have some reduced specs and compromises compared to the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/Low-Cost-A18-Pro-MacBook-Feature-Pink.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028724\" />\r<br/>\nWhile we are still waiting for Apple to announce the new MacBook, a leaker has shared eight alleged limitations to expect, based on an internal version of Apple's Kernel Debug Kit for a macOS Tahoe beta, leaked online last year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHere are the alleged limitations they outlined in a post <a href=\"https://weibo.com/7215797790/5270244492576120\">on Chinese social media platform Weibo</a> and in an email to <em>MacRumors</em>:<ul><li><strong>Lower max display brightness:</strong> The leaker said the lower-cost MacBook's maximum display brightness may fall below the MacBook Air's 500 nits.</li>\r<br/>\n  <li><strong>No True Tone:</strong> The lower-cost MacBook will apparently lack <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/102147\">True Tone</a>, a feature that can adjust the color and intensity of the display to match the ambient light.</li>\r<br/>\n  <li><strong>No 1TB or 2TB storage capacities:</strong> The leaker expects the lower-cost MacBook to be available in 256GB and 512GB storage capacities, and they mentioned a potential 128GB capacity for educational institutions. Unlike the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, the new MacBook would lack 1TB and higher storage options.</li>\r<br/>\n  <li><strong>Slower SSD speeds:</strong> The flash storage in the new MacBook base model will apparently have slower read and write speeds compared to the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models, potentially due to Apple using a single NAND chip.</li>\r<br/>\n  <li><strong>No fast charging:</strong> The new MacBook might not be \"fast-charge capable.\"</li>\r<br/>\n  <li><strong>No backlit keyboard:</strong> The keyboard may lack backlit keys.</li>\r<br/>\n  <li><strong>No high-impedance headphones support:</strong> You can <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/108351\">connect high-impedance headphones</a> directly to compatible Mac computers introduced in 2021 or later, but the lower-cost MacBook will apparently not be one of them.</li>\r<br/>\n  <li><strong>No N1 chip:</strong> All of the iPhone 17 and iPhone Air models feature Apple's custom <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-n1-chip/\">N1 chip</a> for Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread. Apple says the chip also improves the overall performance and reliability of features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop. However, the lower-cost MacBook will not use the N1 chip, the leaker said. Instead, the laptop will likely have a MediaTek chip for wireless connectivity.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>The information above comes from the same leaker who claimed that Apple's next Studio Display <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/apple-studio-display-2-unusual-feature-rumor/\">may have a 90Hz refresh rate</a>, that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/ipad-mini-a20-pro-chip-rumor/\">next iPad mini will have an A20 Pro chip</a>, and more. Many of their claims are still untested, but we should get a better picture of this source's track record as the products in question are released over the coming months.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile the leaked files are real, this source currently lacks an established track record, so these claims should still be treated with some skepticism. Some of the information mentioned above is not explicitly mentioned in the files, but rather is based on the leaker's interpretations, so it is possible that not every claim will prove to be accurate.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe lower-cost MacBook is expected to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/\">powered by the iPhone 16 Pro's A18 Pro chip</a>, rather than an M-series chip, and it will reportedly have a smaller 12.9-inch display. Based on A18 Pro specs, this MacBook will likely have 8GB of RAM, and the laptop will likely have regular USB-C ports instead of faster Thunderbolt ports.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLike the iBook from the early 2000s, it has been rumored that this MacBook will come in fun color options, like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/low-cost-macbook-yellow-green-blue-pink/\">yellow, green, blue, and/or pink</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe media will likely receive hands-on time with the lower-cost MacBook at the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/apple-announces-special-event-in-new-york/\">\"Apple Experience\" gatherings being held in New York, London, and Shanghai</a> on Wednesday, March 4 at 9 a.m. Eastern Time. There is no Apple Event live stream for this launch, with the new MacBook expected to be announced in a press release.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHow much will this MacBook cost? There are no firm rumors, but estimates for a starting price have ranged from &#36;599 to &#36;799 in the United States.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAfter months and months of rumors, an announcement should be less than a week away.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-a18-pro/\">MacBook (A18 Pro)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/25/lower-cost-macbook-alleged-limitations/\">Leaker Says Apple&#039;s Lower-Cost MacBook Will Have These 8 Limitations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/leaker-says-apples-lower-cost-macbook-will-have-these-8-limitations.2478222/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Lighting company Signify today announced a new SpatialAware scene feature that's coming to <a href=\"https://www.philips-hue.com/\">Philips Hue lights</a>. SpatialAware scenes take into account the position of all of the Hue lights in a room, using an algorithm to distribute light in a more natural way.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/hue-spatialaware-savannah-sunset.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031223\" /><em>The savannah sunset scene with SpatialAware</em></div>\r<br/>\nThe SpatialAware feature analyzes the layout of each room in the home with Hue lights, and then lighting scenes are tailored to your personal space. Lighting is meant to feel more immersive and dynamic than before.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/hue-savannah-sunset-original.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031225\" /><em>The savannah sunset scene without SpatialAware</em></div>\r<br/>\nRight now, when a Scene Gallery scene is activated, the different colors are randomly sent to different lights without the system knowing where those lights are positioned. SpatialAware allows color to be distributed more intentionally for a more natural look. A scene that's designed to mimic a sunset, for example, will set lamps on one side of the room to warm yellow tones to mimic the setting sun, while lamps on the other side are set to darker shades.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSpatialAware requires the Hue Bridge Pro that came out last year, and it uses an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> camera to scan the room to figure out where each light is located. Scans can be updated with each new light that's added. SpatialAware will be accessible through the Scene Gallery, and it is an optional setting.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAt launch, SpatialAware will be compatible with around half of the light scenes available in the Scene Gallery, and it has been designed primarily for nature-based scenes like lake mist, mountain breeze, and savanna sunset.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlong with SpatialAware, Signify is adding support for migrating multiple Hue bridges to a single Bridge Pro during the Bridge Pro setup process, and it is bringing Apple Home support to the Hue Secure camera line.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Hue Secure Camera, Hue Secure video doorbell, and Hue contact sensors will work with Apple Home in the future, and users will be able to stream live video in picture-in-picture mode on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> and get real-time alerts using the Apple Home app.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Hue AI assistant has been updated with the ability to create automations based on natural language user requests, such as \"wake me up at 6:45 a.m. every day except on Saturdays,\" and AI support is expanding to additional languages like Dutch, German, and Spanish.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAutomations for lights and accessories are also now listed in the Rooms and Zones they control for easier adjustment, with options to rearrange content to put the most used automations front and center.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe new Hue SpatialAware feature is launching in spring 2026, while Apple Home support is coming in the first quarter of 2026. Multi-bridge migration and AI assistant automations are available now.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2026/\">CES 2026</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/philips-hue/\">Philips Hue</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/07/philips-hue-spatialaware-scenes/\">CES 2026: Philips Hue Line Get New SpatialAware Scenes, Hue Cameras Gain HomeKit Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2026-philips-hue-line-get-new-spatialaware-scenes-hue-cameras-gain-homekit-support.2475701/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Google TV is built into some TV sets and set-top boxes, and while it may not be immediately relevant to many Apple users, it does give us a look at what AI can do on a TV set.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/google-tv-gemini.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031530\" />\r<br/>\nGemini on Google TV will be able to answer queries with a \"visually rich framework\" that offers up imagery, videos, and real-time sports updates. A \"Deep Dives\" feature will give users narrated, interactive overviews of a topic that are simplified for the whole family.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUsers can search through their Google <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> Library using Gemini to find specific people or moments. It enables image editing on the TV, with options to apply artistic styles or generate cinematic slideshows. Nano Banana, Google's image generator, can reimagine personal photos or create original media right on the TV. Veo, Google's video generation tool, is also coming to Google TV.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGoogle is also adding an option to use natural language to optimize TV settings, which is perhaps the most useful new feature that Gemini integration brings. Users can tell Gemini things like \"the screen is too dim\" or \"I can't hear the dialogue\" to make quick adjustments to picture and sound.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAccording to Google, the Gemini features will be coming to TCL devices first, and other Google TV devices over the coming months.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is planning to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/05/apple-siri-google-gemini-partnership/\">use a version of Google Gemini</a> for some of its upcoming AI features, including the smarter version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>. The next-generation version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> is expected to get an A17 Pro chip, which is compatible with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith Apple adopting Gemini and Apple TVs soon becoming capable of new AI features, it's possible that some of the features that Google has announced for Google TV could be replicated on the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;. Apple could use &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; and the new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to simplify controls, make better content suggestions, and more. The updated &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; and the new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; could both come in spring 2026.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2026/\">CES 2026</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/06/google-gemini-google-tv/\">CES 2026: Google Brings Gemini AI Features to Google TV, Previewing What Apple TV Could Get</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2026-google-brings-gemini-ai-features-to-google-tv-previewing-what-apple-tv-could-get.2475690/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

SwitchBot says that it is designed to learn, adapt, and work in coordination with existing SwitchBot robots like vacuums. It does not have a single function, and is instead meant to adapt to multiple cleaning scenarios.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Onero H1 combines visual perception, depth awareness, and tactile feedback to understand an object's position, shape, and interaction states, which SwitchBot claims is important for contact-intensive household tasks. It can grasp, push, open, and organize, though SwitchBot has not detailed specific tasks that it can complete. SwitchBot is showing off the robot at CES, and says it will be <a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/\">available for pre-order</a> soon.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlong with the H1, SwitchBot is debuting the AI MindClip, a voice-based knowledge engine that records meetings, conversations, and everyday moments. Integrated AI provides structured summaries, to-do lists, and a searchable personal knowledge base. SwitchBot says the MindClip is meant to serve as a \"second brain,\" and with a subscription-based AI cloud service, it allows users to pull up past discussions and reminders on-demand.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/switchbot-ai-recorder.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3751\" height=\"2111\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031523\" />\r<br/>\nSwitchBot is also debuting the Lock Vista Series, a Matter-compatible smart lock that integrates with Apple Home and offers facial recognition capabilities for unlocking a door hands-free. It has DualPower and DualBackup systems with a high-capacity rechargeable battery and a long-life backup battery. A separate Lock Vista Pro also includes palm vein recognition capabilities as an alternative biometric option.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/switchbot-lock.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1126\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031524\" />\r<br/>\nOther SwitchBot products being shown off at CES include the SwitchBot Weather Station with a 7.5-inch e-ink display and built-in sensors, and the Obboto, an expressive globe light that uses AI to offer music visualization and mood animations through 2,900 integrated LEDs.

It is supposed to track soil moisture, temperature, and light exposure data in real time, and there is a little pixel creature that delivers AI insights.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe title=\"Senso Product Intro\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-SDT2yv7V0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r<br/>\nThe pixel creature awakens once the sensor is placed in soil, and users can complete daily and weekly plant care missions to collect rewards and unlock new characters. The sensor has a modular design with different depth options, and multiple sensors for multiple plants can be combined. The AI and an accompanying app are meant to adapt to provide accurate readings across different plant species and pot types.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe device supports voice-based AI interactions, so you can ask it questions to get responses from a \"friendly plant expert.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/ces-2026-senso-plant-sensor.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"854\" height=\"569\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031527\" />\r<br/>\nSenso is being shown off at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2026/\">CES 2026</a>, but it is not an actual product yet.

      "summary": "iOS 26.1 是 iOS 26 操作系统的首次重大更新，预计将于下周初发布。此次更新带来了多项有用的新功能和界面改进，尽管不包含备受期待的新版 Siri。以下是 iOS 26.1 中的主要新功能：\n\n### 界面与显示\n\n*   **Liquid Glass 透明度切换**\n    *   在“设置”>“显示与亮度”中新增选项，可在“清晰”和“着色”之间切换 Liquid Glass 的外观。\n    *   “清晰”模式更透明，是标准版 Liquid Glass，显示按钮、菜单栏等界面元素下方的背景。\n    *   “着色”模式增加 Liquid Glass 的不透明度并增强对比度。\n    ![Liquid Glass 透明度切换](https://images.macrumors.com/t/OCRA_6Z4V4J8hTc_cWfWK-zkX9w=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-liquid-glass-opaque.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **Liquid Glass 折射效果**\n    *   应用周围的光线折射效果在图标颜色和背景颜色较深时变得更加微妙。\n\n*   **设置应用图标和文本对齐**\n    *   “设置”应用中，所有带有文本标题的设置（如“通用”、“蓝牙”、“Wi-Fi”等）现在都改为左对齐，而非居中对齐，带来了显著的视觉变化。\n    ![设置应用左对齐](https://images.macrumors.com/t/iv55lXc9QvRxHGw7hCvNOXHdXF8=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-left-aligned-settings.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **主屏幕文件夹名称对齐**\n    *   点击主屏幕文件夹时，顶部的文件夹名称现在也改为左对齐，与“设置”应用的更改保持一致。\n    ![主屏幕文件夹对齐](https://images.macrumors.com/t/axOjqOqH0LgafqNOadi6a5X8dww=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-folder-alignment.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **电话拨号盘**\n    *   电话拨号盘的数字现在使用 Liquid Glass 效果。\n    ![电话拨号盘 Liquid Glass](https://images.macrumors.com/t/zopNTL2fSpKZ42-mA_uLWCRQasM=/400x0/article-new/2025/09/ios-26-1-phone-app-keypad.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **Apple TV 应用图标**\n    *   Apple TV 应用拥有了一个新的、更具色彩的图标，采用了 Liquid Glass 美学。\n    *   Apple 不再将其流媒体服务称为“Apple TV+”，而是直接称为“Apple TV”。\n    ![Apple TV 应用新图标](https://images.macrumors.com/t/HLvrltLsD-ly6fYnTAw0Xn7yVPU=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/apple-tv-rebrand-icon.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **显示设置壁纸**\n    *   “设置”应用的“显示”部分现在显示 iOS 26 主题壁纸，而非 iOS 18 壁纸。\n    ![显示设置壁纸](https://images.macrumors.com/t/gfg6hLycplDIYMyJ_yiRecFQ2Bw=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/display-brightness-setting-ios-26-1.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **壁纸设置**\n    *   在锁定屏幕上设置壁纸时，“捏合裁剪”等说明会短暂显示后消失，而不是一直显示。\n    ![壁纸裁剪提示](https://images.macrumors.com/t/tfCUacTQHa_O1SIlJJsFOpNse8c=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-wallpaper-crop.jpg?lossy)\n\n### 功能改进\n\n*   **锁定屏幕相机滑动**\n    *   在“设置”应用的“相机”部分，新增“锁定屏幕滑动打开相机”设置，可禁用从锁定屏幕向左滑动打开相机的功能。\n    *   这解决了意外激活相机以及未经授权拍照的隐私问题。\n    ![锁定屏幕相机滑动禁用](https://images.macrumors.com/t/i17B0K49jFQW3xUUGEknOj9iniA=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/lock-screen-swipe-disable-camera.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **电话触觉反馈**\n    *   在“电话”应用中，新增一个开关，用于关闭通话连接或挂断时的触觉反馈。\n    ![电话触觉反馈](https://images.macrumors.com/t/UMkqkmf-Bari68Tyu1ZEHfTiVy0=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-phone-haptics.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **闹钟和计时器**\n    *   “时钟”应用中设置的闹钟和计时器在锁定屏幕上现在使用“滑动停止”按钮，而非“轻点停止”按钮。\n    *   用户可以轻点小睡，但需要滑动才能完全关闭闹钟，这大大降低了意外关闭闹钟的可能性。\n    ![闹钟滑动停止](https://images.macrumors.com/t/JjK3uoWLl9BJuErwKxwehRzIjzw=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-slide-to-stop.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **Apple Intelligence 新增语言**\n    *   Apple Intelligence 现已支持丹麦语、荷兰语、挪威语、葡萄牙语（葡萄牙）、瑞典语、土耳其语、中文（繁体）和越南语。\n\n*   **AirPods 实时翻译新增语言**\n    *   AirPods 实时翻译在 iOS 26.1 中支持更多语言，包括日语、韩语、意大利语和中文（普通话繁体和简体）。\n\n*   **Apple Music 滑动切歌**\n    *   在 Apple Music 播放器中，用户可以通过在歌曲标题区域滑动手指来切换歌曲（下一首或上一首）。\n    ![Apple Music 滑动切歌](https://images.macrumors.com/t/iWj6xpADhwmHwh1o1i3bcGEyAuU=/400x0/article-new/2025/09/ios-26-1-apple-music-swipe.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **健身应用自定义锻炼**\n    *   用户现在可以在 iPhone 的“健身”应用中创建自定义锻炼。\n    *   可选择锻炼类型、预估活动卡路里、强度、持续时间和开始时间，比之前的锻炼创建选项更加开放和自定义。\n    ![健身应用自定义锻炼](https://images.macrumors.com/t/s3Tk9P-7n0vPEyA6y7czqYPBpBo=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-custom-workout.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **照片应用改进**\n    *   照片应用中视频的滑动条已更新。\n    ![照片应用视频滑块](https://images.macrumors.com/t/6217JpyD8uGay5Yk8G91FI0Nsn4=/400x0/article-new/2025/09/ios-26-1-photos-app-video.jpg?lossy)\n    *   导航栏具有更磨砂的外观，使其在浅色背景下更容易辨认。\n    ![照片应用导航栏](https://images.macrumors.com/t/usz4vpVeQA1UFBS85Xc6GKG5uOQ=/400x0/article-new/2025/09/ios-26.1-photos-buttons.jpg?lossy)\n    *   管理多张选中照片的界面略有调整，“播放幻灯片”、“收藏”和“隐藏”现在位于菜单顶部。\n    ![照片应用多选界面](https://images.macrumors.com/t/vu0px3ce6jRWQ_C9VbJW3vOw9Zc=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-photos-app.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **Safari 标签栏**\n    *   Safari 中的底部标签栏更宽，边缘填充更少。\n    *   在“降低透明度”模式下，填充增加，使其不再显得奇怪。\n    ![Safari 标签栏](https://images.macrumors.com/t/CvyRnunBa06d5z3hODkIFLpuxCk=/400x0/article-new/2025/09/ios-26-1-safari-bar.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **后台安全改进**\n    *   “设置”应用的“隐私与安全”部分新增一个开关，用于自动下载和安装安全改进，这是对之前“快速安全响应”功能的改进。\n    ![安全改进设置](https://images.macrumors.com/t/N2DUTGSg62pDDXWyp-A9WSjT7WE=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-security-improvements.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **显示辅助功能**\n    *   在“辅助功能”设置的“显示与文字大小”部分，新增“显示边框”开关，为所有按钮添加边框，取代了之前的“按钮形状”设置。\n\n*   **本地捕获设置**\n    *   在“设置”>“通用”>“本地捕获”中，现在可以选择在“文件”应用中设置通话录音（音频和视频）的保存位置。\n\n### iPadOS 26.1 特有功能\n\n*   **Slide Over 重新引入**\n    *   iPadOS 26.1 重新引入了 Slide Over 功能，它与基于窗口的 iPadOS 26 多任务处理功能协同工作。\n    *   用户可以打开多个窗口，同时仍可滑动以快速访问 Slide Over 应用。\n    *   每次只能有一个 Slide Over 应用，通过点击绿色窗口调整大小按钮并切换“进入 Slide Over”来使用。\n    ![iPadOS Slide Over](https://images.macrumors.com/t/81VOK8kMc_rZGvoseq4jpcJv7Aw=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/ipados-26-1-slide-over.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **iPad 外部麦克风**\n    *   在使用外部麦克风时，iPad 上现在可以调整输入增益。\n\n### 发布信息\n\n*   **可用性**：iOS 26.1 已面向开发者和公共测试版用户提供。\n*   **兼容性**：支持所有兼容 iOS 26 的 iPhone 设备。\n*   **发布日期**：预计将于 11 月 3 日星期一或 11 月 4 日星期二发布。",

      "content": "Apple is currently beta testing iOS 26.1, which will be the first major update to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a> operating system. It's not going to bring the new version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> that we've been waiting for, but it does include useful new features and interface changes. We're nearing the end of the beta testing process, and iOS 26.1 could be released early next week. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1019676\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iOS-26.1-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br/>\nWe've rounded up all of the new features that are included in iOS 26.1. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"liquid_glass_transparency_toggle\">Liquid Glass Transparency Toggle</h2>\r<br/>\nApple added a toggle for customizing the look of Liquid Glass. In Settings > Display and Brightness, there's a new option to switch between Clear or Tinted settings.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-liquid-glass-opaque.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023903\" />\r<br/>\nClear is more transparent and is the standard version of Liquid Glass that displays the background underneath buttons, menu bars, and other interface elements, while Tinted increases the opacity of Liquid Glass and adds contrast.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"lock_screen_camera_swipe\">Lock Screen Camera Swipe</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the Camera section of the Settings app, there's a Lock Screen Swipe to Open Camera setting, and turning it off disables the feature where you can swipe left to open the camera from the Lock Screen.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/lock-screen-swipe-disable-camera.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023906\" />\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> has long allowed users to open the Camera app directly from the Lock Screen with a swipe, but it can be a setting that's easy to activate, and it provides a way for someone that gets ahold of an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to use it to take unwanted photos.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere was previously no way to turn off Lock Screen camera activation without disabling the camera app entirely.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"phone_haptics\">Phone Haptics</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the Phone app, there's a toggle to turn off haptic feedback when a call is connected or dropped.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-phone-haptics.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023918\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"alarms_and_timers\">Alarms and Timers</h2>\r<br/>\nAlarms and timers that you set up in the Clock app now have a slide to stop button rather than a tap to stop button on the Lock Screen. You can snooze an alarm with a tap, but to turn it off entirely, you need to use a slide gesture.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022258\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-slide-to-stop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThe change makes it much harder to accidentally dismiss an alarm when you're trying to tap on the snooze button.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"new_apple_intelligence_languages\">New Apple Intelligence Languages</h2>\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> is now available in Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese (Portugal), Swedish, Turkish, Chinese (Traditional), and Vietnamese.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"airpods_live_translation_languages\">AirPods Live Translation Languages</h2>\r<br/>\nAirPods Live Translation works with additional languages in iOS 26.1, including Japanese, Korean, Italian, and Chinese (both Mandarin Traditional and Simplified).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"apple_music\">Apple Music</h2>\r<br/>\nYou can swipe on the music player in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> to switch songs. Just slide a finger over where the song title is listed, and it'll go to the next song or back to the previous song.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020557\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/ios-26-1-apple-music-swipe.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"apple_tv_app\">Apple TV App</h2>\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> app has a new, more colorful icon that adopts the Liquid Glass aesthetic that Apple added alongside the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ name change. Apple is no longer referring to its streaming service as &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+, and is instead just calling it &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, like the app. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/apple-tv-rebrand-icon.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023126\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"fitness_app\">Fitness App</h2>\r<br/>\nYou can create custom workouts in the Fitness app on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. There are options for selecting workout type, estimated Active Calories, effort, duration, and start time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022278\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-custom-workout.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere were workout creation options before, but they were more structured than the open, custom creation options that are in iOS 26.1.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"settings_app\">Settings App</h2>\r<br/>\nApple changed the alignment of icons and text in the Settings app. All settings with headers that feature text now have that text aligned to the left instead of center aligned. It's a small change that makes a big visual difference.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022272\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-left-aligned-settings.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThis includes General, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Cellular, Personal Hotspot, Accessibility, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"home_screen_folders\">Home Screen Folders</h2>\r<br/>\nWhen you tap into a folder on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a>, the name of the folder at the top is left aligned instead of center aligned, matching the changes made in the Settings app.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022273\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-folder-alignment.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"phone\">Phone</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Phone keypad now uses Liquid Glass for the numbers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020556\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/ios-26-1-phone-app-keypad.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"photos\">Photos</h2>\r<br/>\nThe slider for scrubbing through videos in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app has been updated.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020558\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/ios-26-1-photos-app-video.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThe navigation bar also has a slightly more frosted look that makes it easier to see on light backgrounds.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020567\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/ios-26.1-photos-buttons.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThe interface for managing multiple photos that you've selected has been tweaked slightly.

      "content": "Apple held its earnings call for the fourth fiscal quarter (third calendar quarter) of 2025 today. With quarterly revenue of &#36;102.5 billion, Apple set a new September quarter revenue record, beating analyst expectations. Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> and Apple CFO Kevan Parekh provided insight into <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> sales, holiday quarter expectations, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-796911\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Apple-Logo-Cash-Blue.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nWe've rounded up the most interesting takeaways from the call.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>iPhone 17 Sales</h2>\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q4-2025.html\">Cook said</a> that demand for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> models is \"off the chart.\" Traffic in stores is up significantly, and Cook said that consumer reception is \"very strong.\" Apple set a September quarter record for upgraders.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; supply was constrained during the quarter, and several &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models are still constrained. Cook said Apple is working hard to fulfill all the orders that it has.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen asked why the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; was doing so well, Cook said the following:\r<br/>\n<blockquote>I think it's all about the product. The product lineup is incredibly strong or strong as ever. The 17 Pro is the most pro phone we've ever done. It's incredible. And the design sings. The iPhone air feels so thin and so light in your hand, it feels like it's going to fly away. And then the 17 phone is an incredible value, and takes several of the features that were reserved for pro before and brings them down to the consumer lineup. So overall, strongest iPhone lineup ever, and it's resonating around the world.</blockquote>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>iPad</h2>\r<br/>\nThough Apple refreshed the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> lineup with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, many other iPads haven't had an update as of late. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; sales were flat, with &#36;6.95 billion in revenue.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHalf of customers who purchased an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; during the quarter were new to the product.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Mac</h2>\r<br/>\nMac sales were up, thanks to the launch of new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> models this year. Mac revenue was &#36;8.7 billion, up from &#36;7.7 billion last year. The Mac install base reached a new all-time high.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple said next quarter's Mac sales won't be as impressive because of an \"extremely difficult compare.\" Last year, Apple launched several Macs late in the year, but this year the company only released the M5 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Wearables, Home and Accessories</h2>\r<br/>\nApple's wearables category includes the Apple Watch and Vision Pro. Sales were slightly down at &#36;9.01 billion compared to &#36;9.04 billion last year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Services</h2>\r<br/>\nApple's Services segment hit a new all-time revenue record, reaching &#36;28.8 billion, up from &#36;25 billion in the year-ago quarter.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nServices set revenue records in Americas, Europe, Japan, Rest of Asia Pacific, and a September quarter record in Greater China. Payment services hit an all-time revenue record and there was double-digit growth on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a> active users.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nServices revenue has surpassed &#36;100 billion for the year, up 14 percent.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Siri Revamp</h2>\r<br/>\nApple is still on track to release an upgraded version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> next year, according to Cook. Apple is also planning for more partnerships like the ChatGPT integration in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>AI</h2>\r<br/>\nParekh said that Apple is \"significantly increasing\" its investments in AI, with operating expenses between &#36;18.1 and &#36;18.5 billion expected.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCook said that Apple is continuing to develop its Apple foundation models, and several are in development. But he also said that Apple continually looks at the market and is open to pursuing an acquisition if it will advance the company's roadmap.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>China</h2>\r<br/>\nDespite strong &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sales, revenue in China was down significantly. Cook said that China is expected to return to growth in the December quarter because of the reception to the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRevenue in China was &#36;14.5 billion, down from &#36;15 billion last year, and below analyst expectations of approximately &#36;16.4 billion.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Tariffs</h2>\r<br/>\nApple said that it had &#36;1.1 billion in tariff-related costs in Q4 2025. Apple expects &#36;1.4 billion in tariff-related costs next quarter, assuming that nothing changes. It does include the recent tariff change on goods imported from China, which dropped to 10 percent from 20 percent.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>December Quarter</h2>\r<br/>\nApple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; said that total company revenue would grow 10 to 12 percent year over year in the December quarter. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue is expected to grow double digits, and Apple is projecting that it will have its best December quarter ever.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/\">Earnings</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/30/q4-2025-earnings-call-takeaways/\">Apple&#039;s Q4 2025 Earnings Call Takeaways</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-q4-2025-earnings-call-takeaways.2470160/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

On Mac, we expect a difficult compare against last year. Services to grow in a year over year rate similar to fiscal 2025. Gross margin between 47 and 48%, and estimated &#36;1.4 billion in tariff related costs. We are significantly increasing our investments in AI, with operating expenses between &#36;18.1 and &#36;18.5 billion.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:26 pm</b>: Cash dividend of &#36;0.26/share, payable on November 13, 2025.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:26 pm</b>: Now we're moving to the Q&A portion of the call.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:27 pm</b>: Q: Why do you think the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; is having the degree of success it is as this point? Is this the age of the install base replacement cycle, specific features or functionality this cycle?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: I think it's all about the product. The lineup is incredibly strong, our strongest ever. The Pro is the most pro phone we've ever done, the design sings, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/\">iPhone Air</a> feels so thin and light in your hand it feels like it's going to fly away. And then the 17 phone is an incredible value and brings several features that were reserved for Pro and brings them down to the consumer lineup. Strongest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup ever and it's resonating around the world.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:29 pm</b>: Q: Can you discuss your approach to managing component cost inflation? Memory prices are going through some pretty significant inflation. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: We have a world class procurement team and they're finding ways to drive cost opportunities. We're seeing changes in memory and storage prices, but as seen in our gross margin performance, I think we're managing costs pretty well. We just launched a bunch of new products and they do have a higher cost structure, but we focus on getting those costs down over time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:30 pm</b>: Q: Can you talk about &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in China? How is that trend going into December and have you turned the corner there?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: I was just there, store traffic is up significantly, it's incredibly vibrant and dynamic. The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; family has been very well received there. We believe that we'll return to growth in Q1, largely based on the reception of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; there. I couldn't be more pleased with how things are going there in the early going.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:31 pm</b>: Q: Wondering if the antitrust ruling, if there was anything in the Google trial that affected your performance in Services.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: There was no tax related impact, our strong performance in the quarter was really organically driven. Nothing abnormal at all, pretty much all organic growth.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:33 pm</b>: Q: Services revenue growth was the fastest across many categories and fastest in the last two years, if you could unpack the drivers of the acceleration — was there cross selling with the new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; launch, install base growth, you've been doing a lot of bundling with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/\">Apple One</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a> One, any thoughts on that would be very helpful.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: The way we looked at it, it's not one thing to point to. It's higher than we've seen the last few quarters but the Services profile is very broad with lots of different businesses. Our strength was very broad across categories and geographically, so wouldn't point to one factor that drove any kind of performance.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:34 pm</b>: Q: On &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sell-through, are you seeing any notable shifts in trends between sell-through coming from upgraders versus switchers, US carrier dynamics, promotional activity and channel inventory?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: We set a September quarter record for upgraders so it was a great quarter from that point of view, it's too early in the cycle on 17 to make any comments about upgraders or switchers. In terms of channel inventory we ended the quarter toward the lower end of the targeted range. We are constrained today on several models of &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; today, there's not a ramp issue we just have very strong demand. We are working hard to fill all the orders that we have.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:35 pm</b>: Q: Can you walk through the expectations on gross margin in December quarter, I think it implies up 30 basis points, can you talk through the puts and takes on there?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: Targeting 47-48 percent, a lot of puts and takes. This is a quarter we launched a lot of new products that are more expensive than those we replace, those were more favorable mix and higher leverage, those are the two big drivers but really favorable mix from the product side.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:37 pm</b>: Q: For China, what resulted in the weakness over there and the pause, what drove the weakness in September? What is the uptick for December?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: Greater China revenue was down 4% year over year, driven by &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and if you look at the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, the majority of the sequential year over year change was due to supply constraints mentioned earlier. That drove the results. We're thrilled with what we're seeing now with traffic up and the reception of the 17 family. We expect a return to growth this quarter.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:38 pm</b>: Q: Regarding constraints and demand for iPhones, do you see yourself exiting December without constraints or do you think they'll still be there at the end of the quarter? Do you know what revenue might have been without constraints?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: If you look at the supply constraints, we are constrained on several 17 models. We're not predicting when the supply/demand will balance. We're obviously working very hard to achieve that, we want to get as many of these products out to people as possible. Today I'm not going to predict.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:39 pm</b>: Q: Talked about new records across a lot of categories and services. I didn't hear search explicitly called out. There are some concerns about search volumes decelerating at the expense of AI, how do you see these growth rates continuing for services?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: Advertising, which is a combination of third-party and first-party, did set a record during the quarter.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nQ: Both Apple's internal advertising and external set record?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: I'm not saying that, we don't split that out. I'm dodging the question intentionally.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:41 pm</b>: Q: Strong momentum in China, what are your thoughts on subsidies in that region and how they play a role?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: The subsidies play a favorable role, they're across multiple categories from PCs to tablets, smartwatches and smartphones, but it only applies to certain price ranges, there's a maximum price. Several of our products are above that price are not eligible for a subsidy. It does have a favorable effect and is driving some consumer demand.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:42 pm</b>: Q: On OpEx increase into December, that's a sizable step up. What are the components and that increase in OpEx exceeds your revenue growth, should we expect this to continue?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: As we've been outlining, we are increasing our investments in AI, while also continuing to invest in our product roadmap. Vast majority of the increase is R&D, we're managing the company in a thoughtful and disciplined way an we're managing the business for the long term. We have seen OpEx growing faster than revenue, but we've seen gross margin expansion and operating income growth has been outpacing revenue growth for the past several years.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:43 pm</b>: Q: Can you help us understand the tariff impact sequentially from September to December, especially around &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; supply constraints, tariffs going from &#36;1.1 billion to &#36;1.4 billion, but the uplift on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue and production will be dramatically bigger so how do these tariff headwinds work as we move forward?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: Yes, &#36;1.1 to projection of &#36;1.4, that's based on what we know right now and where the tariff rates and policies are. It assumes a stable environment for the quarter. It does comprehend the changes that were just made that we were very encouraged to see with the tariffs moving from 20% to 10% in China. That is factored in and is one of the reasons why it's not linear to volume.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:45 pm</b>: Q: When you think about it, you're going into a holiday season, the attach possibilties for other products to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in this season, is there an opportunity to see upside to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; attach?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: We always like to remind people who buy an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; of all the other things that we offer. We're definitely doing that. From a Mac point of view, the challenge was the last year was the mother of all Mac launches. All of these, from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a> to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> to all the MacBook Pros all launched literally at the same time. That compares to launching the 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, so it's a very difficult compare. In the long run, I'm very bullish on the Mac. You can see that the Mac again last quarter outgrew the market. We feel really well about how Mac is positioned but this certain quarter is an extremely difficult compare. We also had the DRAM upgrade last year for the Mac lineup, another factor.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:47 pm</b>: Q: On the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; constraints, is there a way to quantify how much business was left on the table because of the constraints, and does different &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; manufacturing from different regions contribute to the constraints?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: It was not related to manufacturing capacity per se. We called the number of &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; that we were going to make and we were a bit short of the demand, we're a bit short of where demand really was. We're not publicly estimating the extent of that. On &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, the demand is very strong and we came out of Q4 with lots of backorders.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:48 pm</b>: Q: Given the prevalence of chatbots and AI-infused web services, do you think that could change consumer behavior on the mobile app ecosystem or are you seeing any of that? Would there be any impact on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: I think there are opportunities on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; with artificial intelligence. We have made our on-device models available for developers and we've seen developers begin to adopt them. As that proliferates, there's an opportunity for developers and Apple to benefit from that.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:49 pm</b>: Q: When we look at the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; demand, has there been any discernable changes in mix relative to prior cycles?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: It's too early to call to the mix to be honest, and we don't publicly disclose that for competitive reasons, but we don't know what the mix will be because we have constraints at both the top and at the entry, we'll see what happens as we get more supply.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:50 pm</b>: Q: As we work through the AI narrative, can you provide thoughts on the build out of AI's private compute cloud?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: Our PCC is being used today for a number of queries for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, and we will continue to build it out. The manufacturing plant that makes the servers used for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> just started manufacturing in Houston a few weeks ago and we've got a ramp planned there for use in our data centers. It's robust. In 2025 we did have CapEx costs associated with PCC environment in our first party data centers, so some of that would be in our CapEx invest this year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:51 pm</b>: Q: Does the consumer reception on &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; give you a feel on the foldable phone market or are the two form factors too different?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: I'm not sure that one is a proxy for the other. The thing that I would say, we don't get into the model demand, at the aggregate level we're thrilled with how &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has been received and that's why we're expecting double-digit growth in the coming quarter.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:52 pm</b>: Q: On personalized &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, would you continue to use the three-prong approach with your own foundation models, partner with LLM providers or potential M&A?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: We're continuing Apple foundation models, we ship them on device and use them in the Private Cloud Compute as well. We have several in development. We also continually surveil the market on M&A and are open to pursuing M&A if we think it will advance our roadmap.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:53 pm</b>: Q: We've often seen Apple be a fast follower, whether with large displays or 4G/5G, are you seeing AI capabilities being a material purchase consideration for consumers or are your record sales levels reflecting other factors?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: There are many factors that influence people's purchasing considerations. We don't have a great, in-depth survey yet on the current &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; yet. It's very new in the cycle and we give it some time to formulate. I would say that &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; is a factor. We're very bullish on it becoming a greater factor. That's the way that we look at it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:54 pm</b>: Q: In the wake of every other tech company raising their CapEx in advance of AI demand, and mentioning scarce capacity, do you anticipate changing your hybrid approach to your own and third-party data centers and the role for Apple silicon?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA: We are expecting increases to CapEx spending related to AI spending... we had investments this year to build out our Private Cloud Compute environment. I don't see us moving away from this hybrid model with first-party and third-party capacity.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>2:55 pm</b>: And with that, the call — and Apple's 2025 fiscal year — are complete!<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/\">Earnings</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/30/apple-4q-2025-earnings/\">Apple Reports 4Q 2025 Results: &#36;27.5B Profit on &#36;102.5B Revenue</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reports-4q-2025-results-27-5b-profit-on-102-5b-revenue.2470151/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

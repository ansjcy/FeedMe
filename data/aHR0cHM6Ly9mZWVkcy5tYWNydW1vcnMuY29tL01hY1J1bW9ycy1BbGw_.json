      "content": "Apple plans to enter the foldable smartphone market in September 2026, debuting its first foldable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. We've heard multiple rumors about the design of the upcoming device, but little has been revealed about the operating system or the software features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/iphone-fold-text.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029302\" />\r<br/>\nRumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold will be around 5.4 inches when closed, and approximately 7.6 inches when open, giving it a 4:3 aspect ratio. We did a video featuring a rough &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold mockup at those dimensions yesterday, which provides an idea of what the device will look like.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe title=\"This Is the Closest Look Yet at Apple's Foldable iPhone\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLiz-FQfb2s\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br/>\nWhen unfolded, the upcoming &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will be bigger than any &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to date, and not too far off in size from the original <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>. The current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; has an 8.3-inch screen size, but the first models had a 7.9-inch display.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSince the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold's inner display will be close to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> in size, will it run iOS or iPadOS? Will it work like a standard &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; when the display is closed, and an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; when it's open? Or will it get something in between?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe haven't heard much about iOS 27 as of yet or what Apple has in store for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold, so it's still a mystery. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> says that iOS 27 will lay the foundation for the foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and future foldables, but that's about it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith a larger display, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold will probably support some kind of split screen view or multitasking option, perhaps even adopting Slide Over. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> support for a 7.6-inch display could make sense, but the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold's display will be an awkward middle size between an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. We haven't heard rumors that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold will work with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, but we also haven't heard rumors that it won't.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support could be useful for quick note taking, sketches, signing documents, editing photos and videos, and more. Steve Jobs famously said \"Nobody wants a stylus,\" but in the years since he touted the ergonomics of the finger, the stylus has evolved. The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; isn't one of the tiny plastic pens or imprecise rubber-tipped styluses that were around back in 2007 when Jobs commented on them. It's a writing implement that accurately mimics a pen or a pencil, and it feels natural to use.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSamsung's foldables supported the optional S Pen for many years, but the latest Galaxy Z Fold7 dropped the feature for a thinner and lighter design, which might not bode well for Apple offering the functionality. Rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold is going to be somewhere around 4.5mm thick when unfolded, which will make it thinner than Apple's 5.1mm <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, the thinnest Apple device to date.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSome dedicated Samsung Galaxy Fold users are <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1lvjoae/samsung_dropped_s_pen_support_on_the_galaxy_z/\">unhappy with the feature's removal</a>, so there are definitely foldable smartphone customers out there who like the flexibility of being able to use a stylus. Rumors suggest that Samsung is considering bringing S Pen support back to the next-generation Galaxy Fold, which will, coincidentally, have a shorter, wider design <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/23/samsung-wide-fold-device/\">to match the iPhone Fold</a>. If Apple implements &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support and Samsung doesn't, it's possible Apple will draw some switchers who don't want to use a foldable without a pen option. The opposite is also a possibility, so Apple could lose customers who don't want a foldable without a pen.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGoogle didn't design a stylus for the Pixel Fold, but it did implement support for the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI), so the device works with third-party USI pens. USI pens don't have the same functionality as the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, lacking features like pressure sensitivity, but the basic stylus functionality is there for those who want it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple could do something similar to Google. Add support for the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; for those who want it, without making it a primary marketing point. That would make the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; available for those who want the extra functionality, but it wouldn't be a necessity. Apple could also design an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold-specific &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; that is sized to the device and able to be charged with it, but it all depends on how Apple wants to market the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf it's marketed as an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support is unlikely. Apple has long championed a touch-first approach, and no &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; clearly separates it from the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. If it's marketed as an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; hybrid device, &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support seems like more of a possibility.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple might not be able to implement &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support at all because of technical limitations. Rumors suggest that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold is so thin that it doesn't have the space for the TrueDepth camera hardware for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a>, so Apple is instead adding a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> button to the device. With space at such a premium, a digitizer layer for the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is probably impossible. Apple also needs to take into account how an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; would impact &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold features like the crease in the middle, and that might add too much complication.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEven if the first-generation &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold doesn't get &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support, it could be a feature that Apple adds in the future as display technology improves.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDo you want &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold?

It sounds like an announcement is planned for January 1, 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Health+ service that's in the works will supposedly incorporate AI for personalized health recommendations and health coaching. Health+ will rely on the LLM version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> that Apple has planned, which isn't expected until iOS 26.4 in the spring, so we're probably not hearing about the service in January.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DS5nXYzEnJz/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

In some cases, there is a low crackle or a hiss when scrolling through webpages when the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is charging, and some people hear the noise at low volumes even when the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; isn't on a charger.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAffected users report that the noise can be heard with chargers of all types, including Apple's official chargers. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> charging causes the problem as well, but users report that the static noise is quieter.

      "content": "Apple's restrained artificial intelligence strategy may pay off in 2026 amid the arrival of a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/30/tim-cook-say-siri-revamp-on-track-for-next-year/\">revamped Siri</a> and concerns around the AI market \"bubble\" bursting, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/2026-predictions-apple-will-reverse-ai-slump\"><em>The Information</em></a> argues.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/apple-intelligence-black.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-963902\" />\r<br/>\nThe speculative report notes that Apple has taken a restrained approach with AI innovations compared with peers such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta, which are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in data centers, chips, and large language model training. This has fueled criticism that Apple is falling behind in the AI space, particularly as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> has significantly lagged behind more advanced, capable, and reliable conversational systems.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe report argues that market sentiment toward AI spending is beginning to show signs of skepticism, with questions emerging over whether such large investments can be justified by near-term revenue. Against that backdrop, Apple's decision to limit AI-specific capital expenditures has left it with more than &#36;130 billion in cash and marketable securities, giving the company the option to pursue acquisitions or partnerships if valuations of AI startups fall.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's biggest AI-related move in 2026 will be the long-anticipated overhaul of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, which is expected to arrive in the spring. The updated assistant is set to be more conversational and capable of completing multi-step tasks. To power it, Apple is believed to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/02/new-version-of-siri-to-lean-on-google-gemini/\">adopting Google's Gemini</a>, reflecting an internal view that large language models may become commoditized and not worth the cost of large-scale proprietary development.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> is said to be a key strategic advantage. Unlike AI companies that rely on standalone apps or web services, Apple can distribute AI features directly through software updates and system-level integrations across its devices. Efforts by AI companies to build competing hardware face major challenges in manufacturing, distribution, and ecosystem development, areas where Apple has very strong footholds.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<em>The Information</em> also points to recent leadership changes as part of Apple's effort to refocus its AI work. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/siri-management-team-overhaul/\">placed under Mike Rockwell</a>, who was responsible for launching the Vision Pro headset, following <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/apple-intelligence-siri-spring-2026/\">significant delays</a> to the assistant's overhaul. In addition, Apple's AI chief John Giannandrea <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/apple-ai-chief-retiring-after-siri-failure/\">announced his retirement</a> earlier in December, with parts of his organization redistributed into product-focused teams amid internal concerns about a lack of clear product direction.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile Apple has a history of early but uneven AI efforts, including the original launch of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; in 2011, <em>The Information</em> argues that these shortcomings have not materially harmed its core businesses. 2026 may be an inflection point in which Apple's cautious strategy could appear prescient if enthusiasm for large-scale AI spending continues to cool and the company finally delivers a more capable version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/\">The Information</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/30/apple-ai-strategy-could-pay-off-in-2026/\">Report: Apple&#039;s AI Strategy Could Finally Pay Off in 2026</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apples-ai-strategy-could-finally-pay-off-in-2026.2475381/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

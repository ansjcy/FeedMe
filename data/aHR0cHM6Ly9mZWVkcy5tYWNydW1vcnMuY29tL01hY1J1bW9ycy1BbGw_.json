      "content": "Apple has a long list of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/upcoming-apple-products/\">new products rumored for 2026</a>, including a series of home products that will see the company establishing more of a presence in the smart home space. Robots are on the horizon for 2027, but the 2026 releases will be a little tamer.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/iOS-26-Home-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034994\" />\r<br/>\n<h2>HomePod mini</h2>\r<br/>\nWe're expecting a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> 2 to launch at any time. Apple isn't going to update the device's design, but we could get new colors. The &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; 2 will have an updated S-series chip based on the Apple Watch Series 10 chip, and there's a possibility for sound improvements and improved real-time computational audio. Apple will also likely upgrade to Bluetooth 5.3 for connectivity improvements, and it could get a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe current &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is &#36;99, and that's not expected to change. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Home Hub</h2>\r<br/>\nApple has been working on a home hub that will serve as a centralized location for all members of the family to control smart home devices, make calls, listen to music, get information like the weather, use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, view photos, see a family calendar, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRumors suggest the home hub will have presence sensors to detect when someone is in the room, and an included camera could be able to tell who is speaking to it so that it can pop up a personalized selection of apps and features for each user.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe home hub is expected to have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a>, built-in speakers, and support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> thanks to an A18 chip. While there won't be a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, the home hub will run Apple apps like Safari, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, Notes, Calendar, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news/\">Apple News</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are two separate models, including one that's designed to be mounted on the wall and one that has a speaker base that looks like a &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Security Camera and Doorbell Camera</h2>\r<br/>\nApple is designing its own <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-home-security-camera/\">indoor security cameras</a> that will connect to Apple Home and interface with the home hub. We've also heard rumors of a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/22/apple-doorbell-with-face-id-rumor/\">potential doorbell camera</a> with &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; that would be able to connect to a door lock. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAny Apple-designed cameras will feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit-secure-video/\">HomeKit Secure Video</a> with end-to-end encryption, but little else is known at this time. There has been mixed information on when we might see Apple's security cameras, but they could come as early as 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Launch Timing</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; and home hub are expected early in the year, likely before WWDC. The cameras, if we get them in 2026, will likely come late in the year. Prior rumors suggested that Apple would release the home hub around the time that the new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; launches. The smarter &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; was expected in iOS 26.4, but it may now be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/siri-features-delayed-ios-26-4/\">pushed back to iOS 26.5</a>. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Read More</h2>\r<br/>\nFor more on what to expect from Apple in 2026, we have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/upcoming-apple-products/\">a dedicated Apple Products guide</a> that lists all of the devices on the horizon. We update it regularly, so it's a useful guide to bookmark and check every now and then to keep up to date with Apple's plans.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/apple-home-2026-rumors/\">Three New Apple Home Products Rumored for 2026</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/three-new-apple-home-products-rumored-for-2026.2477677/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "With the launch of the Creator Studio subscription app offering, Apple may be phasing out the iWork branding that it has used since 2005 for Pages, Keynote, and Numbers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iWork-macOS-Trio-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-818315\" />\r<br/>\nApple today <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/iwork/\">removed the iWork section</a> on its website, and the URL now redirects to a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apps/\">more generic \"apps\" page</a> that features Creator Studio, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a>, Apple Invites, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/\">Image Playground</a>, and other Apple apps.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe iWork page that Apple removed was dedicated solely to Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, featuring information on each app along with a link. Apple's apps page offers some of the same information in a dedicated productivity section, but with additional details on the premium features included in Pages, Numbers, and Keynote with Apple Creator Studio.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apps/\">apps page</a> does not mention the iWork branding at all, suggesting that Apple is no longer referring to the three productivity apps using that term and is instead going to advertise them as Apple Creator Studio apps.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/apple-iwork-page.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1378\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036370\" /><em>Apple's now-removed iWork page</em></div>\r<br/>\nIt's not clear if Apple is going to phase out \"iWork\" entirely, and the term is still used across different <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/imac/design-with-iwork-apd8b783ddd6/mac\">support documents and guides</a>. It may take time to completely eliminate the all-in-one branding that Apple has used for Pages, Numbers, and Keynote for more than 20 years, or it could still be used in some limited situations.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple introduced Keynote as a standalone app in 2003, and added Pages in January 2004. A year later, both apps were bundled together under the iWork '05 name, with the software priced at &#36;79. Apple said iWork was a successor to AppleWorks, an office suite that included a word processing app, a database, a drawing app, and a spreadsheet app. The iWork apps were designed from the ground up, and were essentially the Mac equivalent to Microsoft Office.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn 2007, iWork '08 gained the Numbers app, and in 2009, iWork '09 included an iWork.com service for sharing documents online (discontinued in 2012 in favor of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a>). When iWork '09 came out, Apple started selling the apps for &#36;20 each, later adding them to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-app-store/\">Mac App Store</a> when it launched in 2011. iOS versions of the iWork apps came in 2010 with the launch of the first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, with Apple charging &#36;9.99 each.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple redesigned the iWork apps for Mac and iOS in 2013, and started offering them for free to Mac buyers. Pages, Keynote, and Numbers remain free today, though there are now upgraded features accessible only through the Apple Creator Studio subscription.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple Creator Studio is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/28/apple-creator-studio-now-available/\">priced at &#36;12.99 per month</a>, and in addition to the iWork apps, it includes access to Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage. For Numbers, Pages, and Keynote, Apple Creator Studio adds a content hub with Apple-curated royalty-free photos, premium templates, and themes. There's also a tool to remix image creations right in a document, and a Super Resolution tool for upscaling images.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn addition to iWork, Apple has been phasing out other \"i\" branding terms over the last several years. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ibooks/\">iBooks</a> and iPhoto are now Apple Books and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a>, respectively, while iTunes has been separated into <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/\">Apple Podcasts</a>. Apple still uses \"i\" branding for iMovie, &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>. <div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iwork/\">iWork</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/apple-iwork-website-removed/\">Is Apple Phasing Out the iWork Brand?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/is-apple-phasing-out-the-iwork-brand.2477675/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

For example, there are articles and videos highlighting everything from reasons to upgrade to a newer iPhone to popular iPad features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is aiming to release the \"Sales Coach\" app on Monday, February 23, our source said. It will have two major changes compared to the \"SEED\" app, including an all-new Liquid Glass design, and later an AI chatbot that can provide Apple Store and Apple Authorized Reseller employees with sales tips and product information.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen it arrives in a later update, the chatbot will be accessible from the \"Ask\" tab in the app, and employees will be able to ask it various Apple product knowledge questions. For example, they could ask about the iPhone Air's key features, or inquire about how the Instant Hotspot feature on the Mac works. We have not confirmed if the chatbot uses Apple's own large language model, or if it relies on a third-party platform.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"Sales Coach\" is also rolling out on the web at <a href=\"https://salescoach.apple.com/\">salescoach.apple.com</a>. It is an internal tool for Apple sales partners, so it is not publicly accessible.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Apple-Launching-New-‘Sales-Coach’-App-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4190\" height=\"2356\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036366\" />\r<br/>\nA similar public-facing chatbot has been rolling out <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/03/apple-support-assistant-update/\">in the Apple Support app</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/apple-launching-sales-coach-app/\">Apple Launching New &#039;Sales Coach&#039; App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launching-new-sales-coach-app.2477674/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

In other words, iOS 26 was available for around three weeks longer by comparison.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs was suspected, this means that iOS 26 adoption has officially been slower than iOS 18 adoption, but not to the extent that some earlier, unofficial estimates had claimed. There is no way of knowing exactly why iOS 26 adoption has been slower, but some users have opted to avoid the new Liquid Glass design for now.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\niPadOS 26 adoption figures are technically higher than iPadOS 18, but again, note that iPadOS 26 benefitted from three extra weeks of availability.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/apple-shares-ios-26-adoption-stats/\">Apple Reveals How Many iPhones Are Running iOS 26</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reveals-how-many-iphones-are-running-ios-26.2477659/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The new device is rumored to come with four main new features, including the A19 chip from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> connectivity, the C1X cellular modem, and the N1 chip for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Thread connectivity.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNew iPads are also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/ipad-12-and-ipad-air-8-reportedly-coming-soon/\">on the horizon</a> for the near future. The eighth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> is expected to move to the M4 chip, while the 12th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is expected to jump a chip generation up to the A18, which will also enable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> support for the first time on the device.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis week's biggest story was the news that Apple has again \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/siri-features-delayed-ios-26-4/\">run into snags</a>\" testing the personalized, smarter version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; originally planned for iOS 26.4. Due to the issues, the upcoming &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features will likely be partially delayed and spread across several upcoming iOS releases. Apple could postpone some or all of the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features until iOS 26.5, an update planned for May, and iOS 27, which will launch this September.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple announced a significantly upgraded version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; powered by &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; at its 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference, and it was originally supposed to be part of iOS 18. The following spring, Apple announced that the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/\">would take longer than expected</a>, with the functionality delayed for a year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSince then, Apple has ostensibly been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/apple-intelligence-siri-spring-2026/\">targeting iOS 26.4</a>, which the company will begin beta testing later this month, but there have apparently been unforeseen problems: &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; sometimes doesn't properly process queries and can take too long to respond to requests.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple engineers have been told to use iOS 26.5 for further internal testing, suggesting the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features will be delayed until that update. Employees that are testing iOS 26.5 say the update includes all of the features Apple promised, including personalization, onscreen awareness, and the ability for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to do more in and between apps, but not all of the features are working reliably and there are problems with accuracy.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; also apparently sometimes falls back on using ChatGPT for information instead of relying on the Gemini-powered technology that Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/google-gemini-future-apple-intelligence-features/\">partnered with Google</a> to use, even when the new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is capable of handling a user's request.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple also planned to include features that haven't yet been announced, such as options to generate images with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/\">Image Playground</a> or search the web. Image generation and web search were tested as part of iOS 26.4, and it's possible they will still be included in the update, so Apple might still be able to release some of the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality. <em>Bloomberg</em> says the situation is \"fluid,\" though, so Apple's plans could change, and executives are reluctant to further delay the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality beyond spring 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are still major changes planned for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; as part of iOS 27, with Apple aiming to add chatbot functionality to better compete with the likes of like Gemini and ChatGPT. This new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will also reportedly have deeper integration with apps and Apple's operating systems.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow\">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1\"><div class=\"fancybutton\">Subscribe to <em>The MacRumors Show</em> YouTube channel!</div></a></div>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYou can also listen to &zwnj;The MacRumors Show&zwnj; on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/id1602394741\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/41XOHIA6w8IxAKJZvrnx90\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/itunes1602394741\">Overcast</a>, or other podcast apps.

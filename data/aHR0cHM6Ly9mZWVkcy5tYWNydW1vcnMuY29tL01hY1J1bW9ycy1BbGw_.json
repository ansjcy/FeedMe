      "content": "Apple released iOS 26.2 on December 12, introducing the latest version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>. iOS 26.2 isn't the biggest update, but it brings quite a few helpful new features to your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/iOS-26.2-Whats-New-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027938\" />\r<br/>\nWe've rounded up all of the new features your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is getting in iOS 26.2.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"alarms_for_reminders\">Alarms for Reminders</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Reminders app has a new option to have an alarm go off when a reminder is due. Setting up an alarm can be done by toggling on the \"Urgent\" option when creating a reminder.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025665\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-alarm-reminders.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen a Reminder alarm activates, it displays a snooze option or a slide to stop option. If you snooze it, it will show a Live Activity countdown on the Lock Screen that includes an option to complete the reminder or reschedule it. Apple distinguishes Reminders alarms from standard alarms with a new blue color.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple provides a splash screen letting users know about the feature, plus a small banner that shows up when you go to add a new entry in the Reminders app after updating to iOS 26.2.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027254\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-b3-reminders.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"lock_screen\">Lock Screen</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Lock Screen has a new Liquid Glass slider that lets you customize the appearance of the time. When using the \"Glass\" option, you can use the slider to make the time look almost entirely clear, or give it a more frosted look.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025676\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-liquid-glass-toggle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThere's still a separate Solid toggle that turns off the Liquid Glass appearance for the clock entirely if you want to opt for a much more opaque design, and you can also still use the color options for the time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025677\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-liquid-glass-slider-extremes.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"liquid_glass_settings\">Liquid Glass Settings</h2>\r<br/>\nWhen using the Liquid Glass \"Tinted\" option that reduces transparency, there's a warning that the Tinted option cannot be used in tandem with the Reduce Transparency and Increase Contrast Accessibility settings.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027253\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-b3-tinted-mode.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nTurning on Tinted mode is able to turn off Reduce Transparency and Increase Contrast automatically. In the prior update, there was no option to turn on Tinted mode without turning off these features manually.\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"airdrop\">AirDrop</h2>\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 increases the security of AirDrop. The update adds an extra layer of verification when using AirDrop with unknown contacts.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027227\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-airdrop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThere is an option to generate an AirDrop code on the receiver's device, which can then be entered on the sender's device to complete the transfer. Codes allow AirDrop to work for a 30-day period.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPeople you have shared a code with can be managed by opening up the Settings app, selecting the General section, choosing AirDrop, and tapping on \"Manage Known AirDrop Contacts.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"apple_music\">Apple Music</h2>\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> supports offline lyrics, so you can see a song's lyrics when not connected to Wi-Fi or cellular.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYour Favorite Songs playlist also now shows up in Top Picks on the home tab.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"sleep_score\">Sleep Score</h2>\r<br/>\nWith iOS 26.2 and watchOS 26.2, Apple has adjusted the ranges for the Sleep Score feature that it introduced earlier this year. The new Sleep Score numbers better match how people might be feeling after a night of sleep.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025635\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/watchos-26-2-sleep-score.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThese are the new scores:\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n <li><strong>Very Low</strong> - 0-40 (previously 0-29)</li>\r<br/>\n <li><strong>Low</strong> - 41-60 (previously 30-49)</li>\r<br/>\n <li><strong>OK</strong> - 61-80 (previously 50-69)</li>\r<br/>\n <li><strong>High</strong> - 81-95 (previously 70-89)</li>\r<br/>\n <li><strong>Very High</strong> - 96-100 (previously 90-100)</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nThe \"Very High\" rank used to be \"Excellent,\" but Apple changed the name to be more in line with the other labels.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSleep Scores are available on all Apple Watch models compatible with watchOS 26.2 and can be found in the Health app on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Apple designed Sleep Score to provide an overall sense of sleep patterns, so users can identify habits that might impact their sleep.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSleep Score takes into account sleep duration, bedtime, and interruptions to assign a nightly score that represents sleep quality. Duration is worth 50 points, bedtime is worth 30, and interruptions (times woken up in the night) are worth 20, for a total of 100 possible points each night.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"podcasts\">Podcasts</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Podcasts app has three new features, including automatically generated chapters, options to see mentions of other podcasts from the transcript and the player, and access to links mentioned in a podcast on the episode page.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025681\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-podcasts.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"passwords\">Passwords</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the Settings section of the Passwords app, there's an option to manage websites where passwords are not saved when signing in.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025696\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-passwords-excluded-websites.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"5541\" height=\"3117\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"freeform\">Freeform</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Freeform app now supports tables that can hold text, images, documents, and drawings. Cells intelligently resize to fit content, providing structure.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025697\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-freeform-tables.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"apple_news\">Apple News</h2>\r<br/>\nApple updated the design of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news/\">Apple News</a>, adding quick access top buttons for categories like sports, puzzles, politics, business, and food.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025698\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-apple-news-update.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThere's also a dedicated tab for Following, which has been decoupled from the search interface.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"home_app\">Home App</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Home app now supports multipack accessory pairing. You can use the same setup code to enroll multiple accessories that are sold together.\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"flash_for_alerts\">Flash for Alerts</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Flash for Alerts option in the Accessibility section of the Settings app allows users to have the screen flash when there's an incoming notification. Previously, this setting was limited to the LED on the back of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025699\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-flash-alert.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nUsers can swap to the screen flash or have both flash at the same time when notifications come in.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"enhanced_safety_alerts\">Enhanced Safety Alerts</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the Notifications section of the Settings app, there's an Enhanced Safety Alerts section for managing earthquake alerts, imminent threat alerts, and activating improved alert delivery, a feature that uses location to improve the reliability of alerts.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025700\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-safety-alerts-enhanced.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple says that Enhanced Safety Alerts provide rich information like a map of affected areas and links to additional safety guidance.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEnhanced Safety Alerts is limited to the United States.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"measure_app\">Measure App</h2>\r<br/>\nApple's Measure app now features a Liquid Glass design for the level, with two Liquid Glass bubbles instead of white circles.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026669\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-measure-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"games_app\">Games App</h2>\r<br/>\nThere's an option to sort games in the Games app Library by size, in addition to Name and Recent. In-game challenge score banners provide real-time updates when someone new has taken the lead in a game you're playing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026670\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-games-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThe Games app also supports navigation with a controller and real-time updates to challenge scores during gameplay, plus there's enhanced support for controllers like the Backbone and Razer.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027255\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-b3-games-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"carplay\">CarPlay</h2>\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a> app supports disabling pinned messages in the Messages app for drivers who prefer the classic Messages view that was available before iOS 26.2.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005145\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/CarPlay-Pinned-Messages.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"menu_animations\">Menu Animations</h2>\r<br/>\nFor pop-out menus that expand from a corner button, iOS 26.2 adds a quicker, bouncier animation that looks like the animation that Apple showed off at WWDC.\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"privacy\">Privacy</h2>\r<br/>\nWhen you access your Apple Account for the first time after installing iOS 26.2, you'll see an alert letting you know that Apple's privacy information for Apple Accounts has been updated to better explain how personal information is collected and used by Apple.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027252\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-b3-apple-account.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"airpods_live_translation_for_eu\">AirPods Live Translation for EU</h2>\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 expands AirPods Live Translation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/04/ios-26-2-expands-live-translation-on-airpods-to-eu/\">to the European Union</a>. Apple had to delay the feature in the EU to complete the engineering work needed to comply with the requirements of the Digital Markets Act.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025657\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/AirPods-Live-Translation.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br/>\nAirPods Live Translation works with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro 3</a>, AirPods Pro 2, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a> with ANC. It is available in English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional Mandarin), Japanese, and Korean at the current time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"iphone_changes_in_japan\">iPhone Changes in Japan</h2>\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"siri_replacement\">Siri Replacement</h3>\r<br/>\nApple is laying the groundwork for a new option that will let &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in Japan choose a different default voice assistant. A press and hold gesture on the Side Button only activates ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>‌ in earlier versions of iOS.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in Japan will be able to select a new voice-based conversation app to activate with the Side Button, allowing alternative assistants like Gemini or Alexa to be used on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/ios-26-2-iphone-users-japan-siri/\">Developer documentation confirms</a> that it will only be available for Japanese Apple Accounts owned by people living in Japan.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"search_engine_choice\">Search Engine Choice</h3>\r<br/>\nAfter installing iOS 26.2, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in Japan <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/05/japan-safari-choice-ios-26-2/\">will be prompted</a> to select a preferred search engine. Options include Bing, Google, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo Japan, or Ecosia, the same options available globally in the Safari settings. In most other countries, Google is the default search engine and there is no prompt to choose a different option when the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ first starts up.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-961055\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/apple-search-engine-settings-safari.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nWhile ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ users outside of Japan can choose one of the other options, doing so requires going into the Safari section of the Settings app to make a change.\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"third_party_app_stores\">Third Party App Stores</h3>\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 will allow &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in Japan to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/05/ios-26-2-third-party-app-stores-japan/\">install alternative app marketplaces</a>, similar to the European Union.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"texas_app_store_changes\">Texas App Store Changes</h2>\r<br/>\nWith iOS 26.2, Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/04/ios-26-2-texas-age-verification-law/\">adding tools for developers</a> that will help them comply with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> Accountability Act that goes into effect in Texas in 2026. Apple users in Texas will need to confirm whether they are 18 years or older when creating an Apple Account, and parents will need to provide consent for their children's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; downloads and in-app transactions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple will share user age range information with developers, and developers will need to implement systems for notifying parents about significant app changes and allowing parents to revoke a child's access to an app at any time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"bonus:_ipados_26.2_multitasking\">Bonus: iPadOS 26.2 Multitasking</h2>\r<br/>\nIn iPadOS 26.2, Apple is expanding on the updated multitasking that it introduced in iPadOS 26.1. There's an option to drag and drop apps from the App Library, Dock, and Spotlight into Slide Over and tiled views, restoring some functionality that was removed in the iPadOS 18 to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a> transition.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022261\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/ipados-26-1-slide-over.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"bug_fixes\">Bug Fixes</h2>\r<br/>\nThere are two notable bug fixes in iOS 26.2. Apple addressed an issue that could cause pre-release albums in the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Library not to be playable at release time, and it addressed an issue where a Privacy and Security setting could be incorrectly marked as managed by an enterprise organization.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"security_updates\">Security Updates</h2>\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 addresses over 20 vulnerabilities, including two bugs that are known to have been actively exploited.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are a pair of WebKit vulnerabilities that could allow maliciously crafted web content to execute code or cause memory corruption. Apple says that the bugs might have been exploited in an attack against targeted individuals on versions of iOS before &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOne of the WebKit bugs was fixed with improved memory management, while the other was addressed with improved validation.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are several other vulnerabilities that were fixed too, across apps and services. An &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; bug could allow users to access sensitive payment tokens, processing a malicious image file could lead to memory corruption, photos in the Hidden Album could be viewed without authentication, and passwords could be unintentionally removed when remotely controlling a device with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNow that these vulnerabilities have been publicized by Apple, even those that were not exploited before might be taken advantage of now. Apple recommends all users update their devices to iOS 26.2, iPadOS 26.2, and macOS Tahoe 26.2 as soon as possible.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h2>\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 is available on all iPhones that support &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"whats_next\">What's Next</h2>\r<br/>\nApple is likely to release the first beta of its next update, iOS 26.3, as soon as next week.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-2-features/\">iOS 26.2 Features: Everything New in iOS 26.2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-2-features-everything-new-in-ios-26-2.2474623/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

You might want to double check your settings just in case, and even if iOS 26.2 didn't turn on automatic software updates, it's worth knowing about the possibility because it's an option that Apple can sneak into any update. If you've ever had an update mysteriously install on your device when you didn't manually do it, it's probably because automatic software updates was quietly turned back on.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf you did install iOS 26.2 and accidentally turned on automatic updates, you can undo it by going to General > Software Update > Automatic Updates and toggling the option off.

      "content": "<a href=\"https://us.govee.com/\">Govee</a> makes just about every kind of light you can think of, and many of those are Matter-capable and able to connect to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a>. Earlier this year, Govee came out with a series of Matter star projectors, which you can hook up to your Apple Home setup.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/govee-light-projector-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1690\" height=\"950\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029986\" />\r<br/>\nThere are three new projectors, including the Star Light Projector Nebula, the <a href=\"https://us.govee.com/products/govee-star-light-projector-ocean-wave\">Star Light Projector Ocean Wave</a>, and the higher-end <a href=\"https://us.govee.com/products/govee-galaxy-light-projector-2-pro\">Galaxy Light Projector 2 Pro</a>. I was intrigued by the idea of HomeKit-connected light projectors, so I tested two of the three products.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Star Light Projector (Ocean Wave)</h2>\r<br/>\nThere are two variants of the Star Light Projector, the Nebula that mimics the night sky, and <a href=\"https://us.govee.com/products/govee-star-light-projector-ocean-wave\">the Ocean Wave</a> that has more of an oceanic vibe. The Ocean Wave Star Light Projector is one of Govee's more affordable projectors at &#36;50 on sale, and it's a fun nightlight experience, especially for children.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/ios-26-2-ocean-wave.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029991\" />\r<br/>\nThe projector is on a rotating base that can be adjusted as needed for the space that it's in, and it covers up to 540 square feet. It's more than big enough to bathe the entire ceiling of your average bedroom in soft, shifting light. It's about eight inches tall and six inches long, so it can tuck right on a bedside table or dresser to light the room.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere is a textured lens that covers four RGBW lamp beads, and together, that setup allows for a water-like ripple pattern. I didn't think it necessarily looked quite like I was underwater, but some colors were more convincing than others.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/govee-ocean-wave-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029996\" />\r<br/>\nAlong with the light under the lens, there's a laser module that projects pinpoints of light meant to be stars. The laser light looks like stars, and that was somewhat confusing with the water aesthetic. I ended up with mesmerizing light effects, but not a lighting experience that made me feel like I was under the sea or looking at the sky. It's a chaotic mix that doesn't quite work.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile the lighting effects produced by the projector feature multiple colors and patterns that can be adjusted in the app, the laser is a static green color and it can't be changed. If the laser light is on, it's green, and that didn't look great with some of the other colors. You need a fairly dark room for the projector to work as intended. It needs to be the only light that's on, and it needs to be dark outside.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/govee-ocean-wave-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1501\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029997\" />\r<br/>\nThere is an included speaker and you can turn on white noise options to add to the oceanic effect, but the speaker quality was just okay. I am someone that sleeps with white noise, and I would not pick the projector over another noise machine. For a child that doesn't know much of a difference, the sounds would likely be plenty soothing, and it might also work well for meditation. My cat was enthralled with it, so pets can enjoy the lighting effects too. If you don't like the white noise options, you can connect to it via Bluetooth and play music from an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. There is a subtle noise from the projector, but I'm not sure you would hear it unless you were right next to it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe laser can be turned off, and the light can be dimmed for sleep, plus there are options to set timers. This would make for a great nightlight/sound machine in a child's room, and all the different settings and light patterns are fun to play with. The app has quite a few presets to choose from, some of which have an accompanying sound and some of which don't, but you can also create your own. I liked the amount of control I had and all of the patterns available with this model, because surprisingly, the more expensive model is a bit more limited in scope because of its specialization.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/govee-ocean-wave-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029998\" />\r<br/>\nThis model does not come with a power adapter, so you'll need to supply your own, but it does come with a USB-C to USB-A cable. The USB-A side plugs into the power adapter, and I would have much preferred a USB-C to USB-C cable so I didn't have to hunt down a USB-A power adapter, which I have been ridding my house of.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Govee Galaxy Light Projector 2 Pro</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Galaxy Light Projector 2 Pro is Govee's higher-end projector option, and it's quite a bit different from the more affordable Star Projector variants. I don't have much experience with projectors, so this review ended up sending me down a rabbit hole.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/govee-projector-pro-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029992\" />\r<br/>\nWhy would someone pay &#36;160+ for this projector when there are options with more customizability at a lower price? The answer is resolution and the ultimate feel of the lighting effect. The Projector 2 Pro doesn't use different colored lights and textured lenses, instead passing light through high-resolution film discs.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are eight film discs to select from, and the image on the film is projected onto the ceiling or the wall. The discs have good variation in color and effect, but I was disappointed to learn that there are no additional discs I can buy. These are also proprietary, so you can't exactly buy discs somewhere else and pop them into the projector.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/light-projector-pro-2-blue.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029995\" />\r<br/>\nThere's a 4-megapixel lens and a 230 lux light, and the combination produces vivid colors and a realistic effect that feels like you're immersed in space. Govee says that you don't need total darkness for the projector to work, but that's not really true. It looks a lot better when the room is completely dark.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/star-light-projector-pro.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029990\" />\r<br/>\nYou can leave a nightlight on or have a lamp on in the room, but it really fades the effect. Even a TV washes it out too much. You also need to make sure to adjust the focus after you get the light positioned where you want it to project, otherwise it will look blurry. If you don't have a dark enough room and don't adjust the focus, it's going to look washed out. You also need to ensure you have good placement in a room and the right angle. There is soft motor sound when the projector is turned on, and occasionally, I noticed some minor jumps in rotation. I am sound sensitive and the noise didn't bother me, but if it's right next to your head and you want total silence, it could be an irritation.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Light Projector 2 Pro covers up to 300 square feet with a 90 degree projection, which is ideal for bedrooms. I found it to be a little too small for the living room, and it does look best when it can cover an entire ceiling. I have vaulted ceilings in most rooms. In rooms with higher vaulted ceilings, the projector didn't look the best, perhaps because the distance was just too far. Lower ceilings looked better, and on Amazon, Govee actually recommends using the star projector within a distance of 3.28 feet to 9.84 feet, ruling out taller ceilings.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/govee-projector-pro-2-nebula.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029993\" />\r<br/>\nThe projected scenes rotate to provide movement, and a laser that provides moving stars adds to the effect. The laser is blue, which means the stars are always blue. Blue works well with most scenes, but with both of the light projectors I tested, I wanted to be able to change star color. Laser color is static, though, and there aren't multiple options, which is a major downside. The laser stars have two different movement patterns, including diffuse or gather, both of which created unique effects with each film disc. Star speed can be adjusted, and the stars can also be turned off entirely.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are preset scene options to choose from, some of which are tied to white noise, but even with the more expensive Light Projector 2 Pro, I didn't like the white noise quality. The speaker is just okay and doesn't sound like it has any depth. I would not get this for the white noise function.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/govee-light-projector-pro-2-stars.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029994\" />\r<br/>\nThe projector has a separate, rubberized base, and the shape of the projector allows it to be positioned anywhere on the base, so it's easy to adjust the angle to get the light in the right spot. There's a 90-degree projection angle to work with. The device is nine inches long and six inches wide, so it's a little bigger than the more affordable models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Galaxy Light Projector 2 Pro does provide a realistic night sky effect that's immersive and pretty to look at, but you are limited to the eight different discs. Star patterns and scenes mix things up a bit, but it can get boring looking at the same pattern night after night. I think this projector looks great, but it needs more scene options and I hope Govee sells additional discs in the future.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere is nowhere on the projector to store discs, so it's easy to misplace them. Govee does give you a little book to store them in, but just one sleepy night of not putting a disc away has the potential to result in a lost one. I also can't seem to take the discs out of the projector or put them in without touching the film, which is frustrating.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Govee App</h2>\r<br/>\nThe projectors connect to Wi-Fi and can be controlled with the Govee app. The app has a main view where you can see each Govee product, and you can tap on one to get to the different options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/govee-ocean-light-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029999\" />\r<br/>\nThe Govee app is fine for the most part. It works and does what I expect, but it's also messy. There are ads for other products in several places, and controls that are offered without explanation. It's definitely an app that has the potential to be confusing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/govee-star-light-projector-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030000\" />\r<br/>\nFor the Ocean Wave projector, you can control the speed of the light and to some extent, the color, but colors are dictated by the bulbs inside. They aren't multi-color LED bulbs, so you can't set it to any color that you want. Changing wave speed also doesn't make that much of a difference, so there is a limited amount of customization. You can turn off the wave effect or the stars and enable preset scenes, some of which have accompanying sounds.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Galaxy Light Projector 2 Pro has fewer settings because there are no colors. You can change the speed of image rotation, change the speed of the stars, and turn those features on or off. You can also adjust the direction of the stars and activate scenes that have accompanying music. The preset scenes were a disappointment for the most part because almost all of them turn off the projection and rely just on a star pattern.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are features in the app that seem unnecessary, like AI for describing scenes (mostly because there are so few actual options that make a visual difference), and a community feature that shows videos of scenes other people have created. There are some practical options for the two projectors, like controlling the timer, setting times for the projector to turn on, and grouping devices together for multi-device control.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>HomeKit</h2>\r<br/>\nYou can bind the Govee projectors to &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; using Matter, as long as you have a Matter hub. In the Apple ecosystem, HomePods and Apple TVs serve as hubs.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/govee-light-home-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030001\" />\r<br/>\nThere's a limited amount that you can do with &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj;, and it doesn't offer the full suite of customizations that are available in the Govee app. You can turn the light on or off and include it in scenes and automations along with other &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; products.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt supports changing the light color as with any &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; light, but this feature doesn't work in practice because the Home app offers color options that are not supported by the projector. You can also use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> to turn the projector off and on, which can be useful, and you can change the brightness.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Bottom Line</h2>\r<br/>\nBoth projectors are fun nighttime accessories, but I can only recommend the Star Light Projector Ocean Wave. It doesn't have discs to fuss with, there are multiple color options to play with, and it's not too expensive.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Galaxy Light Projector 2 Pro looks awesome, but there are too many caveats. The room has to be entirely dark, the ceiling height has to be right, the angle has to be right, and you have to adjust the focus just right. Even meeting those parameters, you get a limited number of scenes with no option to purchase additional discs. If it were priced closer the Ocean Wave and Nebula projectors, that might make it more worthwhile, but this doesn't feel like a &#36;180 device.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI wouldn't recommend buying either of these projectors at full price, but there are often sales you can catch.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>How to Buy</h2>\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGovee-Projector-Effects-Assistant-Options%2Fdp%2FB0FL2431W5%2F\">Star Light Projector Ocean Wave</a> is priced at &#36;50 from Amazon, and the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGovee-Galaxy-Projector-Megapixel-Planetarium%2Fdp%2FB0FL29G4R4\">Galaxy Light Projector 2 Pro</a> is available for &#36;160 from Amazon.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<em><small>Note: Govee provided MacRumors with an Ocean Wave Light Projector and Galaxy Light Projector 2 Pro Projector for the purpose of this review.

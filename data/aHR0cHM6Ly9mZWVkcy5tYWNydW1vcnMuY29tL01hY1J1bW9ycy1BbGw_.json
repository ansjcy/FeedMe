      "content": "2025 is rapidly drawing to a close, but this week still saw some interesting news in the world of Apple, led by a report claiming that Tim Cook's retirement as Apple CEO might not be too far away.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/top-stories-2025-11-22a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027922\" />\r<br/>\nThis week also saw word that the future of the Mac Pro appears to be in question, while Apple continues to work on the upcoming iOS 26.2 update and related releases. Black Friday is also right around the corner now with lots of deals already available, so read on below for details on these stories and more!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Top Stories</h2>\r<br/>\n<h3>Report: Tim Cook to Step Down as Apple CEO 'as Soon as Next Year'</h3>\r<br/>\nApple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/15/report-tim-cook-to-step-down-as-soon-as-next-year/\">preparing for Tim Cook to step down as CEO of the company \"as soon as next year,\"</a> according to the <em>Financial Times</em>. The company's board of directors and senior executives \"recently intensified preparations for Cook to hand over the reins,\" the report said, with Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering, John Ternus, viewed as Cook's most likely successor.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/Tim-Cook-WWDC-2018.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"910\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027020\" />\r<br/>\nCook will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/tim-cook-might-not-fully-retire/\">likely transition to a chairman role with Apple</a>, but his level of influence in a post-CEO role remains to be seen. Arthur Levinson, the current chairman of Apple's board of directors, is 75 years old and prohibited from being re-elected under Apple's corporate governance policy unless an exception is made.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWord of Cook's impending retirement comes as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/15/apple-executive-jeff-williams-retires/\">former Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams officially retired last week</a> after spending the past few months winding down his responsibilities and handing them off other executives.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Mac Pro Reportedly on 'Back Burner' and 'Largely Written Off' at Apple</h3>\r<br/>\nApple's high-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/16/mac-pro-on-back-burner-largely-written-off/\">Mac Pro desktop computer is currently \"on the back burner,\"</a> according to the latest word from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Mac-Pro-Feature-Blue.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-880541\" />\r<br/>\nIn his <em>Power On</em> newsletter this week, Gurman said he heard that Apple has \"largely written off\" the Mac Pro, with the sentiment inside the company being that the Mac Studio represents the present and future of Apple's pro desktop computing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is working on a high-end M5 Ultra chip, but Gurman said the company is currently \"only\" focused on a new Mac Studio with that chip, which leads him to believe that the Mac Pro \"won't be updated in 2026 in a significant way.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Black Friday Deals Available Now on AirPods, iPads, Accessories, and More</h3>\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/21/apple-black-friday-available-now/\">Holiday shopping deals continue to ramp up</a> ahead of Black Friday, with great prices available now on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/21/early-black-friday-airpods-deals/\">AirPods</a>, AirTag, Apple Watch, Macs, iPads, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/General-Black-Friday-Deals-25-Red.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024895\" />\r<br/>\nApple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/20/apple-announces-2025-black-friday-event/\">announced details on its own Black Friday event</a> with bonus gift cards available with the purchase of many Apple products, but better straight-cash discounts are typically available from other retailers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn addition to Apple's own products, we're seeing great early Black Friday deals from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/samsung-early-black-friday-sale/\">Samsung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/18/sony-early-black-friday-sale/\">Sony</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/14/walmart-black-friday-deals-2025/\">Walmart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/19/adobe-black-friday-sale/\">Adobe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/19/nomads-apple-watch-bands/\">Nomad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/21/sonos-black-friday-sale-2/\">Sonos</a>, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Everything New in iOS 26.2 Beta 3</h3>\r<br/>\nApple is continuing to work on iOS 26.2 and related updates, with public releases likely coming in mid-December.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/iOS-26.2-Glass-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025449\" />\r<br/>\nWith the third developer beta of iOS 26.2 seeded this week, we saw <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/ios-26-2-beta-3-features/\">a number of changes and improvements</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/ios-26-2-airdrop-codes/\">new AirDrop functionality</a>, a new API to allow third-party apps to tap into Hypertension Notifications, and the ability for users in Japan to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/ios-26-2-iphone-users-japan-siri/\">set an alternative voice assistant app</a> to be activated using the iPhone's side button traditionally used for Siri.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is also continuing to work on iPad multitasking, with a new tweak to add <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/ipados-26-2-beta-3-multitasking/\">drag-and-drop functionality</a> to the revived Slide Over feature.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>iPhone Pocket Now Available to Order, But Rapidly Selling Out</h3>\r<br/>\nApple recently teamed up with Japanese fashion brand ISSEY MIYAKE to create the iPhone Pocket, a limited-edition knitted accessory designed to carry an iPhone.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/iPhone-Pocket-Short.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026842\" />\r<br/>\nThe accessory <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/14/iphone-pocket-already-selling-out/\">became available to order on Apple's online store</a> last week Friday in the United States, France, China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and the United Kingdom, but it sold out within hours in the United States, and supplies quickly began running short in other countries as well.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>iPhone 17 vs. iPhone 16 Wi-Fi Speeds: New Study Reveals the Winner</h3>\r<br/>\nA new study has revealed that the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone Air <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/18/ookla-apple-n1-chip-iphone-17-wifi-study/\">achieve significantly faster average Wi-Fi speeds</a> compared to the iPhone 16 series, thanks to Apple's custom-designed N1 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iPhone-17-Pro-and-Air-N1-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020530\" />\r<br/>\nThe study by Ookla, the company behind the popular Speedtest website and app, found the N1 chip to be a \"substantial upgrade,\" with up to 40% faster average download and upload speeds compared to Broadcom's Wi-Fi chip in the iPhone 16 series. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOokla found that the N1 chip \"lifts the floor\" for Wi-Fi performance, more than \"raising the ceiling.\" Based on the results, Ookla said the N1 chip often delivers more consistent performance in challenging Wi-Fi conditions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>MacRumors Newsletter</h2>\r<br/>\nEach week, we

We’ve rounded up all of the new features your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will get in iOS 26.2.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/iOS-26.2-Glass-Slider-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027937\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"reminders\">Reminders</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the Reminders app, there’s a new option to have an alarm go off when a reminder is due. Setting up an alarm can be done by toggling on the “Urgent” option when creating a reminder.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025665\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-alarm-reminders.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen a Reminder alarm activates, it displays a snooze option or a slide to stop option. If you snooze it, it will show a countdown on the Lock Screen that includes an option to complete the reminder or reschedule it. Apple distinguishes Reminders alarms from standard alarms with a new blue color.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple provides a splash screen letting users know about the feature, plus a small banner that shows up when you go to add a new entry in the Reminders app after updating to iOS 26.2.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027254\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-b3-reminders.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"lock_screen\">Lock Screen</h2>\r<br/>\nThere is a Liquid Glass slider on the Lock Screen that lets you customize the appearance of the clock. When using the “Glass” option, you can use the slider to make the time look almost entirely clear, or give it a more frosted look.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025676\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-liquid-glass-toggle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThere continues to be a separate Solid toggle that turns off the Liquid Glass appearance for the clock entirely if you want to opt for a much more opaque design, and you can also still use the color options for the clock.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025677\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-liquid-glass-slider-extremes.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"liquid_glass_settings\">Liquid Glass Settings</h2>\r<br/>\nWhen using the new Liquid Glass “Tinted” option that reduces transparency, there’s a warning that the Tinted option cannot be used in tandem with the Reduce Transparency and Increase Contrast Accessibility settings.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027253\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-b3-tinted-mode.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nTurning on Tinted mode is able to turn off Reduce Transparency and Increase Contrast automatically. In the prior betas, there was no option to turn on Tinted mode without turning off these features manually.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"airdrop\">AirDrop</h2>\r<br/>\nApple added <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/ios-26-2-airdrop-codes/\">new AirDrop functionality</a>, providing a way for two people to share files temporarily without having to add one another as contacts.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027227\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-airdrop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 includes an option to generate a one-time AirDrop code, which can then be shared with someone who is not in your contacts list. The code allows file exchanges over AirDrop for a 30-day period.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPeople you have shared a one-time code with can be managed by opening up the Settings app, selecting the General section, choosing AirDrop, and tapping on “Manage Known AirDrop Contacts.”\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"apple_music\">Apple Music</h2>\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> now supports offline lyrics, so you can see a song’s lyrics when not connected to Wi-Fi or cellular.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"sleep_score\">Sleep Score</h2>\r<br/>\nWith iOS 26.2 and watchOS 26.2, Apple has adjusted the ranges for the Sleep Score feature that it introduced earlier this year. The new Sleep Score numbers better match how people might be feeling after a night of sleep.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025635\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/watchos-26-2-sleep-score.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThese are the new scores:\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n <li><strong>Very Low</strong> - 0–40 (previously 0–29)</li>\r<br/>\n <li><strong>Low</strong> - 41–60 (previously 30–49)</li>\r<br/>\n <li><strong>OK</strong> - 61–80 (previously 50–69)</li>\r<br/>\n <li><strong>High</strong> - 81–95 (previously 70–89)</li>\r<br/>\n <li><strong>Very High</strong> - 96–100 (previously 90–100)</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nThe “Very High” rank used to be “Excellent,” but Apple changed the name to be more in line with the other labels.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSleep Scores are available on all Apple Watch models compatible with watchOS 26.2 and can be found in the Health app on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Apple designed Sleep Score to provide an overall sense of sleep patterns, so users can identify habits that might impact their sleep.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSleep Score takes into account sleep duration, bedtime, and interruptions to assign a nightly score that represents sleep quality. Duration is worth 50 points, bedtime is worth 30, and interruptions (times woken up in the night) are worth 20, for a total of 100 possible points each night.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"podcasts\">Podcasts</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Podcasts app adds support for three new features, including automatically created chapters, options to see mentions of other podcasts from the transcript and the player, and access to links mentioned in a podcast on the episode page.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025681\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-podcasts.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"passwords\">Passwords</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the Settings section of the Passwords app, there’s an option to manage websites where passwords are not saved when signing in.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025696\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-passwords-excluded-websites.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"5541\" height=\"3117\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"airpods_live_translation_for_eu\">AirPods Live Translation for EU</h2>\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 expands AirPods Live Translation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/04/ios-26-2-expands-live-translation-on-airpods-to-eu/\">to the European Union</a>. Apple had to delay the feature in the EU to complete the engineering work needed to comply with the requirements of the Digital Markets Act.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025657\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/AirPods-Live-Translation.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br/>\nAirPods Live Translation works with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/\">AirPods Pro 3</a>, AirPods Pro 2, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a> with ANC. It is available in English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional Mandarin), Japanese, and Korean at the current time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"freeform\">Freeform</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Freeform app now supports Tables.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025697\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-freeform-tables.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"weather\">Weather</h2>\r<br/>\nThere is code suggesting that the Weather app now supports relative time for alerts like “next Friday,” or “next Tuesday” in reference to upcoming rain or weather conditions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"apple_news\">Apple News</h2>\r<br/>\nApple updated the design of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news/\">Apple News</a>, adding quick access top buttons for categories like sports, puzzles, politics, business, and food.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025698\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-apple-news-update.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThere’s also a dedicated tab for Following, which has been decoupled from the search interface.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"flash_for_alerts\">Flash for Alerts</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Flash for Alerts option in the Accessibility section of the Settings app now allows users to have the screen flash. Previously, this setting was limited to the LED on the back of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025699\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-flash-alert.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nUsers can swap to the screen flash or have both flash at the same time when notifications come in.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"enhanced_safety_alerts\">Enhanced Safety Alerts</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the Notifications section of the Settings app, there’s an Enhanced Safety Alerts section for managing earthquake alerts, imminent threat alerts, and activating improved alert delivery, a feature that uses location to improve the reliability of alerts.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025700\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-safety-alerts-enhanced.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"measure_app\">Measure App</h2>\r<br/>\nApple’s Measure app now features a Liquid Glass design for the level, with two Liquid Glass bubbles instead of white circles.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026669\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-measure-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"games_app\">Games App</h2>\r<br/>\nThere’s now an option to sort games in the Games app Library by size, in addition to Name and Recent.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026670\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-games-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThe Games app also supports navigation with a controller and real-time updates to challenge scores during gameplay.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027255\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-b3-games-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"carplay\">CarPlay</h2>\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a> now app supports disabling pinned messages in the Messages app for drivers who prefer the classic Messages view that was available before iOS 26.2.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005145\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/CarPlay-Pinned-Messages.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"menu_animations\">Menu Animations</h2>\r<br/>\nFor pop-out menus that expand from a corner button, there’s a quicker, bouncier animation that looks like the animation that Apple showed off at WWDC.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Liquid Glass animation in iOS 26.2 beta 2 is amazing, feels like what was shown off at WWDC <a href=\"https://t.co/J6YruZz4cR\">pic.twitter.com/J6YruZz4cR</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1988746455478415685?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"privacy\">Privacy</h2>\r<br/>\nWhen you access your Apple Account for the first time after installing iOS 26.2, you’ll see an alert letting you know that Apple’s privacy information for Apple Accounts has been updated to better explain how personal information is collected and used by Apple.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027252\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-b3-apple-account.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"iphone_changes_in_japan\">iPhone Changes in Japan</h2>\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"siri_replacement\">Siri Replacement</h3>\r<br/>\nApple is laying the groundwork for a new option that will let &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in Japan choose a different default voice assistant.

Options include Bing, Google, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo Japan, or Ecosia, the same options available globally in the Safari settings.

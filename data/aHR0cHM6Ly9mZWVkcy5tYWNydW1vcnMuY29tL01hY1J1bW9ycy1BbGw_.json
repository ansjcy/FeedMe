      "content": "Apple is testing iOS 26.3, the next version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a> that will launch around January. Since iOS 26.3's testing is happening over the holidays, it is a smaller update with fewer features than we've seen in prior betas.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/iOS-26.3-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029939\" />\r<br/>\nWe've rounded up what's new so far, and we'll add to our list with subsequent betas if we come across any other features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Transfer to Android</h2>\r<br/>\nApple is making it simpler for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users to transition to an Android smartphone in iOS 26.3, introducing a new transfer tool that lets an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user place their device next to an Android device to initiate a transfer process.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030192\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/ios-26-3-android-transfer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nWith the two smartphones connected, users can opt to move over photos, messages, notes, apps, passwords, phone number, and more. Data transfers occur with no need to download and use a separate app, making the process simpler.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHealth data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and protected items like locked notes are not transferred over to the new device. Google has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/08/iphone-android-switching-improvements/\">also implemented</a> a similar feature for transferring data from an Android to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, so it is a two-way process between the two platforms.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Notification Forwarding</h2>\r<br/>\niOS 26.3 has a new \"Notification Forwarding\" setting that allows incoming notifications on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to be forwarded to a third-party wearable device like an Android smartwatch.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/ios-26-3-notification-forwarding.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2114\" height=\"1189\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030197\" />\r<br/>\nThe setting is located in the Notification section of the Settings app under a new \"Notification Forwarding\" option. Apple says that notifications can only be forwarded to a single device at a time, so if Notification Forwarding is enabled with a third-party wearable, the Apple Watch won't be able to receive and display notifications.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is adding this feature to address antitrust complaints suggesting that third-party wearables should have the same access to notifications and other features as the Apple Watch. It is only available in the European Union.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Weather Wallpaper</h2>\r<br/>\nThere is a new Weather wallpaper section in the Lock Screen customization options. Previously, Apple had a combined section for Weather and Astronomy, but Weather was split out into its own category.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/ios-26-3-weather.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030238\" />\r<br/>\nThere are now three pre-designed Weather wallpapers with different fonts for the time and different weather widgets to give people a better idea of how the Weather wallpaper can be used.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>More Features</h2>\r<br/>\nKnow of a feature we left out? Let us know in the comments below.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h2>\r<br/>\niOS 26.3 is available on all iPhones that support &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"release_date\">Release Date</h2>\r<br/>\nWe're expecting Apple to release iOS 26.3 in late January.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/ios-26-3-beta-1-features/\">iOS 26.3 Beta 1 Features: What&#039;s New So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-3-beta-1-features-whats-new-so-far.2474772/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

We recapped device codenames in our prior article, and now we have a list of some of the most notable feature flags that were found in the software code.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Logo-Top-Half.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-968676\" />\r<br/>\nIn some cases, it's obvious what the feature flags are referring to, while some are more vague and harder to interpret. We've included the feature flag and a short explanation of what it might reference, but keep in mind that Apple doesn't provide full explanations because this is all internal code. We're working off of titles and internal organization, but there are still hints of what may be coming in the future.\r<br/>\n<h2>Products</h2>\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Unknown home accessory</strong> - There's a reference to J229 architecture. J229 is a home accessory, but we don't know what it is. It might be the camera that Apple is rumored to be working on, but it could also be something simpler like a standalone base for the home hub. Code references a sensor manager and sensing predict models.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>AirTag 2</strong> - There are several references to future <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTag</a> features, including Bluetooth improvements, low battery state improvements, and crowdsourced location improvements. Unknown references include AirTag2025_Phone_Finding, AirTag2025_Watch_Finding, Distribution, Battery, and Switchover. Note that it mentions 2025, suggesting Apple planned to release the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2 in 2025 and pushed it back.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>AirPods</strong> - Several AirPods features are listed with a spring 2026 launch: ContextualReminders, ConversationBreakthroughVQA, and Visual Lookup. There are also mentions of \"Precise outdoor location understanding\" and \"Room Aware Connect Controls.\" There's a second fall 2025 label for \"Extended_Precision_Finding_Core_Tech,\" and a \"SRAudioMixing - Mix audio with the active streaming device\" mention that could be related to the AirPods.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Vision Pro</strong> - There's a \"Enable AUSM Enhanced Room Spatializer\" feature flag, which may be released to the Vision Pro. It has a spring 2026 label.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\n<h2>Software Features</h2>\r<br/>\nThere are mentions of several previously rumored software features that are coming in updates to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; and in iOS 27.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Health+</strong> - This is listed with a spring 2026 date. Rumors suggest it's a new AI-powered health-related subscription service. There are references to another health feature called \"Gumdrop,\" but it's unclear what it is, plus a mention of a \"Geronimo\" feature with a date of 2030.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Live Captions</strong> - Live Captions will expand to more languages, with this code labeled WWDC 2026.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>AutoFillUI</strong> - Third-party apps will be able to access autofill credit card information in fall 2026. Currently, you can take a picture of card details when checking out or use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a>, but you can't autofill your credit card details when buying something in an app.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Siri</strong> - There are several mentions of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> features for the smarter version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Apple is working on. IntelligenceFlow, PlanOverrides, SpotlightPersonalAnswersSiri, SpotlightSearchToolLLMQueryUnderstanding, and SpotlightExtSemanticSearch are some of the strings. The &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; mentions have a spring 2026 label.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Freeform</strong> - Freeform is getting folders, with a spring 2026 date listed.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Journal</strong> - Followup prompts are coming to the Journal app, also in spring 2026.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Wallet</strong> - There are BankConnectUpcomingPaymentNotifications and AppleCardUpcomingPaymentNotifications strings with a WWDC 2026 date.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Photos</strong> - Apple's code mentions <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> Connections and Shared Collections as features coming in fall 2026.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strongApple TV</strong> - There's a mention of Dynamic Sports Tier Manager for spring 2026.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\n<h3>2027</h3>\r<br/>\nThere are a handful of health features that have a WWDC 2027 label attached.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li>sleepCloudKitManatee</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>sleepCloudKitSync</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>sleepOnIpad</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>sleepOnMac</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\n<h2>Accessibility</h2>\r<br/>\nThere are multiple accessibility features, some of which have WWDC 2026 or fall 2026 dates, and some with no dates.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Live Captions</strong> - Labeled as LiveCaptionsForAll, unclear what it is.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Background Sounds</strong> - A Version 2 is coming.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>macOS Keyboard</strong> - Full Keyboard Access VoiceOver Support for macOS. Mac is also getting extended font size range.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Magnifier</strong> - There are Announce Stairs, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a> Item, and Human Hand Pose mentions.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Live Listen</strong> - The software references Live Listen controls from watch, Live Mic levels on watch, and a Rewind 30 seconds feature for Live Listen.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Tilt to Scroll</strong> - There's a mention of a Tilt to Scroll feature.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\n<h2>Other Features</h2>\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>CallKit</strong> - CallKit mentions a Push-to-Talk option.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>ConversationKit</strong> - There's an \"Experimental_CallScreening_LiveActivity\" string.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>FinHealth</strong> - This section mentions reverse lookup, habitual spend, and spending summaries. Possibly something <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a> related.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Mail</strong> - There's a CatchUpHighlightsV2 string with a winter 2025 date.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Podcasts</strong> - Podcasts references enabling the Home &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; assistant cell for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a>, enabling the Connected Subscriptions Account settings page, adding a button to translate a transcript, and tapping a translated paragraph to hear it spoken.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Vision Pro stickers</strong> - There are mentions of a sticker creation feature for visionOS. Sticker effects and emoji creation are also mentioned.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nKeep in mind that Apple's plans can change, so while this is a glimpse of what Apple was working on around the June 2025 timeline, it may not be accurate any longer. Features can be scrapped, launch dates can be pushed back, and this list definitely doesn't include all of the new features that Apple has in the works for future software updates.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/ios-software-leak-apple-features/\">Early iOS 26 Software Leak Uncovers Dozens of Upcoming Apple Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/early-ios-26-software-leak-uncovers-dozens-of-upcoming-apple-features.2474769/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

This week, we learned where the information came from, plus we have more findings from the leak.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/apple-beta-26-lineup.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005210\" />\r<br/>\nAs it turns out, an Apple prototype device running an early build of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a> was sold, and the person who bought it shared the software. The OS has a version number of 23A5234w, and the first developer beta of &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; was 23A5260n, so it dates back to before that initial beta. Apple was still calling it iOS 19 internally at that time, so the software is labeled iOS 19 rather than &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAn anonymous source provided <em>MacRumors</em> with a list of unreleased devices and features that were found in the beta, and we've recapped the device list below. There are references to many upcoming Apple products, which are referred to by codenames internally.

Apple says that notifications can only be forwarded to a single device at a time, so if Notification Forwarding is enabled with a third-party wearable, the Apple Watch won't able to receive and display notifications.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUsers can choose to have a device receive notifications only from selected apps rather than all apps, and notifications will include the name of the app and all content contained in the notification. This is a feature that is only available to those living in Europe.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is adding this feature to relieve regulatory pressure that it is facing. The Digital Markets Act in the European Union requires Apple to provide third-party smartwatches and other devices with access to notifications and features that are normally reserved for the Apple Watch. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>Update:</b> This article was updated to clarify that Notification Forwarding is only an option in the EU, even though it shows up on iPhones worldwide in iOS 26.3. \r<br/>\n<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/ios-26-3-notification-forwarding/\">iOS 26.3 Adds Notification Forwarding Option for Third-Party Wearables</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-3-adds-notification-forwarding-option-for-third-party-wearables.2474759/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

With the two smartphones connected, users can opt to move over photos, messages, notes, apps, passwords, phone number, and more. Data transfers occur with no need to download and use a separate app, making the process simpler.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHealth data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and protected items like locked notes are not transferred over to the new device.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTransferring data from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to an Android device wirelessly requires both devices to have the latest software, and to be connected to Wi-Fi with Bluetooth enabled. There will be an option to display a QR code on the Android device that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can scan to initiate the process, or there is an option to use a session ID and pairing code instead.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGoogle has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/08/iphone-android-switching-improvements/\">also implemented</a> a similar feature for transferring data from an Android to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, so it is a two-way process between the platforms.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLast week, the European Commission said that Apple and Google designed and implemented the new transfer system to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/09/eu-dma-apple-google-switching-tools/\">comply with the Digital Markets Act</a> in the European Union, but it is not a Europe-only feature.

      "content": "Apple is planning to launch new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/new-macbook-pros-could-now-arrive-in-march/\">as soon as early March</a>, but if you can, this is one generation you should skip because there's something much better in the works.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/m5-macbook-pro-deal.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025807\" />\r<br/>\nWe're waiting on 14-inch and 16-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, with few changes other than the processor upgrade. There won't be any tweaks to the design or the display, but later this year, a massive refresh is coming. Rumors suggest that there won't be just one &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; refresh in 2026, but two.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAfter launching M5 Pro and M5 Max &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models in the spring, Apple will do another update in late 2026, introducing the first OLED &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models. The OLED &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; is expected to feature a design refresh, faster M6 chips, all new display technology, and, in a first for the Mac, touch screen capabilities.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt's going to be the biggest update to the Mac lineup since Apple silicon chips came out in 2020. iPhones have used OLED for years, and Apple brought it to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> in 2024, but Macs don't use OLED yet.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple said for years and years that the Mac <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/11/14/phil-schiller-touch-screen-macs/\">wouldn't get a touch screen</a>, but times change. Multiple rumors suggest that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/17/kuo-2026-oled-macbook-pro-touch-panel/\">touch capabilities are coming</a>, making the Mac more like an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>. Touch-based controls will be available right alongside traditional mouse and keyboard input options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe OLED &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models will be the first to use Apple's 2-nanometer chip technology, and they could even be the first Macs with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-cellular-mac-custom-modem/\">cellular capabilities</a>. With so many changes in store, it doesn't make much sense to buy an M5 Pro or an M5 Max &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; with much better options coming just months later.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOLED touch displays will be limited to the higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch models because of the cost, so the warning isn't applicable to the standard M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; that came out last fall. The entry-level &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; isn't expected to get the same upgrades, though it is likely to get an M6 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt's also possible OLED will be so expensive that it's limited to a single, super expensive high-end model, but we're still probably looking at M6 chip upgrades and a design refresh across the lineup.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTwo Mac refreshes in a single year is unusual, but not unheard of. Apple refreshed the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> Pro and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max chips in January 2023, and then updated the machines again with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips in October 2023.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNormally a Mac refresh results in a Buy Now recommendation from us, but this year, with rumors of two updates in 2026 and so much expected from the later models, those interested in a high-end, premium &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; should plan to wait.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">MacBook Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/10/macbook-pro-buying-advice-2026/\">Why You Shouldn&#039;t Buy the Next MacBook Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/why-you-shouldnt-buy-the-next-macbook-pro.2477499/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Prior to now, the Fitbit service was limited to Android users.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/fitbit-health-coach.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1167\" height=\"637\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1035886\" />\r<br/>\nThe Gemini-powered Fitbit personal health coach is described as a 24/7 digital advisor that’s meant to work as a virtual fitness trainer, sleep coach, and health and wellness advisor. Users start with a 5 to 10 minute conversation with the coach to outline their motivations and goals, with the Fitbit app then providing health insights in the morning after the user wakes up, after workouts, and before bed.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe app is able to generate a personalized workout plan that tracks core fitness metrics, and it offers up sleep analysis and suggestions for improving sleep. It tracks vitals such as heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen, plus there is a built-in chatbot for asking all kinds of health-related questions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple was supposedly working on a similar AI health coach feature, which was going to be part of a Health+ service planned for launch in iOS 27. Earlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em> said that Apple is scaling back its AI health plans.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is no longer planning to launch an Apple Health+ service that will give users AI health recommendations based on personal health data, but some of the components that Apple developed for the health coach could be repurposed and rolled out as other features as soon as this year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGoogle’s Fitbit AI health coach is now available to Fitbit Premium subscribers in the United States, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. Both iOS and Android users can take advantage of the feature.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGoogle sells <a href=\"https://store.google.com/category/watches_trackers?hl=en-US\">several Fitbit health devices</a>, including the Charge 6, Inspire 3, Versa 4, and Sense 2. Google’s Pixel Watch 3 and Pixel Watch 4 also work with Fitbit Premium and the AI health coach feature.

The capabilities will be available for profile pictures, photos, posts, stories, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/meta-ai-facebook-animation.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1460\" height=\"821\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1035862\" />\r<br/>\nMeta AI's image editing tools can be used to animate a profile picture, adding motion to a still image. Meta says there are several preset animations like confetti, headphones, wave, and heart to choose from, with more to be added throughout the year. There does not appear to be an option for creating custom animations.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nText-based AI prompts can be used for creating images for Facebook Stories and Memories. After uploading a photo to Stories or viewing a memory to share, the Meta AI-powered Restyle option can be used to describe changes that you want to make to the image. Meta will also offer presets with different style options, moods, lighting, colors, and backdrops.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFinally, Facebook is getting an option for adding an animated backdrop to Feed text posts to make them \"more fun and expressive.\" When creating a text post on Facebook, tapping on the rainbow-colored \"A\" icon will provide multiple still and animated backgrounds to choose from. Meta plans to introduce seasonal backgrounds in the future to make posts feel \"timely, festive, and a little more fun.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMeta has been heavily pushing its AI products in Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. Conversations with Meta's generative AI are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/01/meta-ai-ad-targeting/\">used for ad targeting</a> and personalization purposes, with no way to opt out. Meta AI is also used for several image editing and generation features in Facebook and Instagram, plus Meta has adopted it for search across Meta apps.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/\">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/10/facebook-ai-profile-animations/\">Facebook Adding AI Profile Picture Animations and Story Editing Tools</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/facebook-adding-ai-profile-picture-animations-and-story-editing-tools.2477490/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple is working on a foldable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> that's set to come out in September 2026, and rumors suggest that it will have a display that's around 5.4 inches when closed and 7.6 inches when open. Exact measurements vary based on rumors, but one 3D designer has created a mockup based on what we've heard so far.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/iphone-fold-3d-print.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1212\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030937\" />\r<br/>\nOn <a href=\"https://makerworld.com/en/models/2141264-iphone-fold-1-1-replica-with-folding-hinge\">MakerWorld</a>, a user named Subsy has uploaded a 1:1 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold replica (via <em><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3019708/iphone-fold-model.html\">Macworld</a></em>), which can be 3D printed to give you a rough idea of the size of the upcoming foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSubsy claims that the model is \"based on recently leaked CAD drawings of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold,\" but there haven't been actual CAD leaks to our knowledge. There were <a href=\"https://www.iphone-ticker.de/apples-falt-iphone-im-detail-wir-haben-cad-zeichnungen-bekommen-270043/\">reports of CAD drawings</a> earlier this month, but it turns out those drawings were concept drawings and renders created by <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rumoured-iphone-fold-size-concept-drawing-and-renders.2456447/\"><em>MacRumors</em> reader iZac back in May</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\niZac designed a mockup with a 5.5-inch display when the device is closed, and 7.76 inches when open. That's in line with the multiple rumors that we've heard, but so far, we don't have exact dimensions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile you can now print a 3D mockup of iZac's concept, the design isn't based on an actual CAD render. It's likely somewhat similar to what the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold will look like in terms of size, but Apple's design for the cameras and the hinge will probably differ quite a bit.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf you have a 3D printer, it's a useful way to get something that's close to the size of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold so you can see how it compares to your existing &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. We'll likely see more accurate CAD renders and dummy models starting to surface in the first months of 2026.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/23/have-a-3d-printer-you-can-make-your-own-iphone-fold-dummy/\">Have a 3D Printer?

      "content": "A Texas federal judge today blocked an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> age verification law that was set to go into effect on January 1, 2026, which means Apple may not have to support the changes after all.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-833991\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Desaturated.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br/>\nThe Texas &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Accountability Act (SB2420) requires Apple and other app marketplaces to confirm user age when a person creates an Apple Account. Apple Accounts for users under 18 would need to join a Family Sharing group, with new controls available for parents and restrictions for minors.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn a preliminary injunction that delays the implementation of the act, Judge Robert Pitman said that it violates the First Amendment and is \"more likely than not unconstitutional.\"\r<br/>\n<blockquote>The Act is akin to a law that would require every bookstore to verify the age of every customer at the door and, for minors, require parental consent before the child or teen could enter and again when they try to purchase a book. As set out below, the Court finds a likelihood that, when considered on the merits, SB 2420 violates the First Amendment.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nThe injunction was in response to a motion filed by the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a group that includes Apple and Google. Today's decision is a win for Apple, as Apple has been fighting against age assurance requirements in Texas and other states. Apple says that the Texas law impacts user privacy.\r<br/>\n<blockquote>While we share the goal of strengthening kids' online safety, we are concerned that SB2420 impacts the privacy of users by requiring the collection of sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nThe court will move on to determining whether the law is facially invalid, which would mean that it is unconstitutional and will be entirely thrown out.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/texas/\">Texas</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/23/texas-app-store-law-blocked/\">Texas App Store Age Verification Law Blocked by Federal Judge</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/texas-app-store-age-verification-law-blocked-by-federal-judge.2475130/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The \"Wide Fold\" will compete with Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> Fold that's set to launch in September 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Iridescent-Search.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-995557\" />\r<br/>\nSamsung's existing Galaxy Z Fold7 display is 6.5 inches when closed, and 8 inches when open, with a 21:9 aspect ratio when folded and a 20:18 aspect ratio when open. Samsung has used a similar size for its prior Z Fold devices.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold's display will measure in at 5.3 to 5.5 inches when closed, and 7.5 to 7.8 inches when open (rumors vary). It's squatter and wider than Samsung's taller, narrower design, with a 4:3 aspect ratio when open.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSamsung's \"Wide Fold\" will coincidentally feature a 7.6-inch display when open, and a 5.4-inch display when closed. It's also expected to have a 4:3 aspect ratio, making it noticeably different than prior models because of the more square shape.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe wider 4:3 aspect ratio is expected to be more comfortable to hold than a taller device, similar to a notebook.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<em>ETNews</em> says that Samsung plans to release its wider foldable device in the fall of 2026, which is also when the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold will be coming out. The wide fold will join the next-generation Galaxy Fold for a total of two \"Fold\" devices, plus there will be a flip device.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/23/samsung-wide-fold-device/\">Samsung Developing &#039;Wide Fold&#039; With iPhone Fold-Like Design Ahead of Apple&#039;s 2026 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-developing-wide-fold-with-iphone-fold-like-design-ahead-of-apples-2026-launch.2475125/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

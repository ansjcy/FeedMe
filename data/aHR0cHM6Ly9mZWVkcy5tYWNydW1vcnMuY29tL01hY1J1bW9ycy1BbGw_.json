      "content": "If rumors are accurate, 2026 is going to be a huge year for Apple. We're expecting the first foldable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, an all-new home hub device, updated displays, and possibly, the first OLED <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> and the first AI smart glasses.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3E3KM7N9_v4\" title=\"Apple’s 2026 Roadmap: Foldable iPhone, LLM Siri, Cheap MacBook\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br/>\nApple will split its &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; launches, introduce a low-cost MacBook, and debut a much smarter, LLM-based version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>. In our 2026 guide, we've outlined everything we know about the new products coming from Apple in 2026, based on current rumors.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"iphones\">iPhones</h2>\r<br/>\nWhile we'll get a low-cost &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e in 2026, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/\">iPhone 18</a> that's normally sold alongside the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro models is supposedly being held back until 2027, which means there won't be a standard &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; in 2026. September 2026 will see Apple launching the foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and the Pro &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, so be prepared to spend some cash if you want a brand new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"iphone_17e_early_2026\"><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/#whats_next_for_the_iphone_16e\">iPhone 17e</a> (Early 2026)</h3>\r<br/>\nAn &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected in early 2026. It could have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/18/iphone-17e-rumored-to-gain-new-design-and-more/\">a refreshed design</a> with slimmed down bezels and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a> instead of a notch, giving it a more modern look that's more in line with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> lineup.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17e-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009543\" />\r<br/>\nAnother rumor says that it will have slimmer bezels but no &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, so it is not clear if it will have a notch or a &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a> did not include a magnetic ring to allow it to attach to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> chargers, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e could include &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; compatibility.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"iphone_18_pro_september_2026\"><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/\">iPhone 18 Pro</a> (September 2026)</h3>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro models will look a lot like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models, but there could be some changes to the display thanks to new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> technology. We're expecting the same 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch size options, with the same bezel, display quality, and rear camera setup with the camera plateau that was introduced in 2025.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/Coffee-Burgundy-and-Purple-iPhone-18-Pro-Mock.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025606\" />\r<br/>\nApple may have finally figured out under-screen &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;, so 2026 could be the year that the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; disappears, allowing for more screen space. Rumors suggest that the &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; components will be under the display, but there will be a hole-punch camera cutout at the top left corner of the screen. It will be a noticeably different look compared to the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models, and if the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; is indeed going away, there will be some loss of functionality. Apple uses the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; to display Live Activities and other important notifications.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro Max could be slightly thicker than the 17 Pro Max, and there's also a chance Apple could use a frosted glass material for the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging area to reduce the two-tone appearance between the glass and the aluminum frame. Rumored color options include burgundy, brown, and purple, but Apple is expected to choose just one to go along with more traditional colors like silver.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro models, Apple is expected to introduce its first chip built on a new 2-nanometer node, the A20. With an updated process, the A20 chip could be up to 15 percent faster than the A19, and up to 30 percent more power efficient, perhaps leading to battery life improvements. Apple is also rumored to be implementing a new packaging technology (Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module, WL-MCM).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple currently uses an SoC that integrates the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, and other supporting components like the Image Signal Processor onto a single die, but RAM is a separate chip that's stacked on top of the SoC during the packaging process. If the A20 is upgraded with WL-MCM technology, RAM will be added at the wafer level (before the wafer is cut into chips) instead of the packaging level (after the wafer is cut), reducing interconnect delays.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith WL-MCM, RAM is more closely integrated with the other chip components, improving memory bandwidth, reducing latency, and boosting efficiency.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro models will continue to feature a triple-lens rear camera setup with Wide, Ultra Wide, and Telephoto lenses, but the main wide-angle lens could get an upgrade. Rumors suggest Apple will add a variable aperture, which would allow users to control the amount of light that's hitting the lens for better performance in low lighting conditions and more control over depth of field. All prior iPhones have had fixed apertures.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple might tweak the Camera Control button, eliminating the swipe-based touch gestures and the haptic feedback. It is easy to accidentally change image parameters when taking a photo because of the Camera Control button's swipe controls. Apple added a setting to disable the swipe functionality in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a> after user complaints, but the button might be better off without it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro could get Apple's C1X modem, or an upgraded C2 modem that supports mmWave 5G. Current &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models use Qualcomm modems, but Apple is ready to expand its in-house modem technology to the entire &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup. An N1 networking chip with combined Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread is expected.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"foldable_iphone_september_2026\"><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a> (September 2026)</h3>\r<br/>\nThe first foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is on track to launch in September 2026, coming seven years after Samsung released its first foldable smartphone. Naming hasn't been announced, but rumors have taken to calling it the \"&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/iphone-fold-text.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029302\" />\r<br/>\nApple is going with a book-style design, so the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold will open and close like a book. When the display is open, it will be around 7.6 inches, and when it's closed, it will be around 5.3 inches. It's said to look similar to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> when it is unfolded, and it will use OLED display technology.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is prioritizing thinness, and so the foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; could be just 4.5mm when it's open, making it Apple's thinnest device by far. When closed, it could be between 9mm and 9.5mm.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; won't have a notch or a &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, and rumors suggest that it might not have &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; at all. Apple could instead use a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> side button, similar to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>. There will be a camera in the top-left corner of the display for taking selfies, and there will also be a pair of rear cameras.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple has been focused on ensuring the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold doesn't have a noticeable crease when it's open, a problem that the company has reportedly solved with display improvements and a strong, durable hinge made from Liquidmetal. The crease is said to be \"nearly invisible\" when the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is unfolded.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple will use the 2-nanometer A20 chip for its fall 2026 iPhones, including the foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold isn't going to be cheap, and rumors suggest the price will be between &#36;2,000 and &#36;2,500. The most recent information is on the higher end of that range.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"ipads\">iPads</h2>\r<br/>\nSeveral iPads are getting updates in 2026, but most will be minor refreshes. The &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is an exception, because rumors say it could get an OLED display. There's no <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> rumored for 2026, with the next update expected in 2027.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"ipad_spring_2026\"><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-12/\">iPad</a> (Spring 2026)</h3>\r<br/>\nA 12th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; could come out in spring 2026, likely around March. There are no changes expected for the design, so it will continue to have an 11-inch edge-to-edge display, &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; Side Button, USB-C, and thicker bezels than other &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ipad-cyber.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028600\" />\r<br/>\nThe next low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is expected to use Apple's A19 chip, which is the chip that Apple used for the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;. It is built on a 3-nanometer process and it will offer major speed and efficiency improvements over the A16 chip that's in the current model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A16 chip that Apple used in 2025 does not support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, but the A19 does, so that will mark a major update for Apple's affordable tablet. The 2026 model should be able to support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features that are unavailable with the 2025 model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A19 also offers hardware-accelerated ray tracing and similar features for improved gameplay. The 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; has 6GB RAM, but Apple will need to bump that up to 8GB for &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt is unusual for Apple to use such a new chip in its most affordable device, but the company may want to ensure that the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is able to keep up with all of the &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features coming in 2026, such as the new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"ipad_air_spring_2026\"><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-air-2026/\">iPad Air</a> (Spring 2026)</h3>\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> will get an early 2026 update, around the March/April timeframe. No design changes are rumored for the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, so we can expect the same 11-inch and 13-inch size options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/ipad-air-blue.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1013750\" />\r<br/>\nApple will upgrade the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; to the M4 chip. The M4 CPU is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3-vs-m4/\">up to 30 percent faster</a> than the M3 CPU, while the GPU is up to 21 percent faster.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn actual use, you may not see much of a difference between the M3 and M4 on the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, though you might experience modest improvements with system intensive games and tasks like video editing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; was upgraded with fast charge functionality with the update to the M5 chip, and that's something that could trickle down to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; could get the N1 networking chip and the C1X modem.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"ipad_mini\"><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/26/oled-ipad-mini-release-date-pricing-what-to-expect/\">iPad mini</a></h3>\r<br/>\nThe next-generation version of the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is rumored to feature a major technology upgrade, with Apple set to adopt an OLED display. The &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; will be the second tablet to adopt OLED after the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/ipad-mini-prime-day-fall.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022104\" />\r<br/>\nAlong with an OLED display, the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; 8 is expected to have a more <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/28/ipad-mini-water-resistance/\">water resistant design</a> that better holds up to splashes and even submersion in water. Apple is creating a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/29/ipad-mini-8-vibration-speakers/\">vibration-based speaker system</a> that uses the display or chassis to produce sound, eliminating the need for a traditional speaker.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith the surface vibration speaker, Apple could remove the speaker holes in the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, making it better able to withstand exposure to moisture.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLeaked Apple code suggests that the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; will feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/ipad-mini-a20-pro-chip-rumor/\">the A20 Pro chip</a>. That's the next-generation chip that we're expecting Apple to use in the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro models, so if the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is using the same chip, it could come out around the same time as the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf Apple ends up going with the A19 Pro instead, the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; could launch earlier in the year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith OLED display technology and the more water resistant design, the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; 8 could be &#36;100 more expensive than the current model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"macs\">Macs</h2>\r<br/>\nApple will refresh the Mac lineup with M5 chips early in the year, plus there's a new low-cost model. Later in the year, there's a possibility we'll get an M6 OLED &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"low-cost_macbook_early_2026\"><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/a18-pro-macbook/\">Low-Cost MacBook</a> (Early 2026)</h3>\r<br/>\nApple is going to release a low-cost MacBook in 2026, with the device set to be more affordable than the &#36;999 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>. With the affordable notebook, Apple is aiming to better compete with cheap Chromebooks and Windows PCs.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/A18-Pro-MacBook-Thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2026\" height=\"1140\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009124\" />\r<br/>\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> believes the low-cost MacBook will have a display that's around 13 inches in size. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has a 13.6-inch display, so the more affordable MacBook could be slightly smaller. It's sounding like it won't be too far off from the 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, though.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are no details on how thick it might be, but Apple probably won't prioritize a thin design for a machine optimized for a low price. Since the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; can run fine with an M-series chip and no fan in an enclosure that's 0.44 inches thick, there's no reason for the MacBook to be any thicker than that.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe low-cost MacBook will have a standard LCD display with no mini-LED technology or ProMotion refresh rate. It could come in bright colors like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, with Kuo suggesting Apple will offer it in silver, blue, pink, and yellow.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is planning to use its A18 Pro chip in the MacBook. We first saw the A18 Pro in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> Pro models. The chip is built on Apple's second-generation 3-nanometer process, featuring 8GB RAM and support for &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt's fast and efficient, and more than capable of handling day-to-day tasks. In Geekbench 6 benchmarks, the A18 Pro offers single-core CPU performance scores at the level of the M3 Ultra, and multi-core performance scores higher than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip that Apple used in the first Apple silicon &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;. Metal scores that measure GPU performance are also similar to the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip Metal scores.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A18 Pro will be equivalent to the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; for some tasks, and faster for other tasks. Apple no longer sells the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; from its own store, but it has offered the machine through Walmart <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/macbook-air-with-m1-chip-599-at-walmart/\">at a &#36;599 price point</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are no specific details on price as of yet, but <em>Bloomberg</em> claims it will cost \"well under &#36;1,000.\" The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;999, so it would need to come in under that.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple could launch the low-cost MacBook in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/04/apple-budget-macbook-2026/\">first half of 2026</a>. Updates are planned for the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; in early 2026, so the low-cost model could launch sometime in that same timeframe.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"macbook_air_early_2026\"><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/m5-macbook-air-release-date-features-performance/\">MacBook Air</a> (Early 2026)</h3>\r<br/>\nApple is working on an updated &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, and rumors suggest that it will come out in the first few months of 2026. It's going to get the M5 chip, but no other new features are rumored. The design will remain the same, and we'll get the same 13-inch and 15-inch size options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/macbook-air-prime-day-2025.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1408\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009086\" />\r<br/>\nBased on updates to the 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, it could also get a faster SSD, and there might be a new color option to replace the light blue from 2025.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"macbook_pro_early_2026\"><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/#whats_next_for_the_macbook_pro\">MacBook Pro</a> (Early 2026)</h3>\r<br/>\n14-inch and 16-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are expected to join the M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; that came out in October 2025.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/macbook-pro-green.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-945035\" />\r<br/>\nThe M5 Pro and M5 Max will have more CPU cores and better GPUs for improved performance, with the chips available in both 14-inch and 16-inch machines. Apple is also expected to add faster SSDs to the new machines.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs with the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, no design changes are expected for the early 2026 refresh, with a major overhaul coming in the final months of 2026 or the early months of 2027.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"mac_mini_mid-2026\"><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a> (Mid-2026)</h3>\r<br/>\nThere is a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a> in development, with M5 and M5 Pro chips.

The M5 Max will offer much faster CPU and GPU performance than the M5, and the M5 Ultra will double the M5 Max.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe haven't heard rumors of design changes or any other updates for the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; as of yet.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"mac_displays_early_to_mid-2026\"><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/\">Mac Displays</a> (Early to Mid-2026)</h3>\r<br/>\nApple hasn't released a new display since the Studio Display launched in 2022, but there are apparently two new models that are in development and slated for release in 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/studio-display-blue-green.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-962222\" />\r<br/>\nThe next-generation version of the Studio Display could feature the same 27-inch screen size, but with mini-LED technology instead of LCD. mini-LED means better HDR, brightness, contrast, and colors. The current Studio Display has an A-series chip inside, and the next-generation version could get the A19 Pro that Apple used in the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are actually two displays in development, but it's unclear if that's the next Studio Display in two sizes, or a Studio Display and a more expensive Pro Display XDR successor.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"oled_macbook_pro_late_2026early_2027\"><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">OLED MacBook Pro</a> (Late 2026/Early 2027)</h3>\r<br/>\nApple is developing a revamped touchscreen OLED &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; that uses next-generation M6 chip technology. It's not yet clear if the machine will come out in late 2026 or early 2027, but 2026 is a possibility.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/OLED-Macbook-Pro-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2363\" height=\"1329\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-788267\" />\r<br/>\nIf Apple does debut the OLED &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; in late 2026, it will be a year with two &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; refreshes. Apple has done that once before when the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> Pro and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max chips launched in early 2023 followed by M3 chips later in the year, but it is a rare occurrence.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRumors suggest that the OLED &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; will feature a hole-punch camera without a notch, maximizing the available display area. The design could be closer to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, but there is no sign that Apple plans to adopt &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; on the Mac. Touch integration will be added to the Mac's screen for the first time, and Apple plans to adopt a reinforced hinge that stays stationary when the display is touched, and cuts down on any vibration associated with touch-based gestures.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOLED technology offers better brightness, a higher contrast ratio with deeper blacks and whiter whites, better colors, and less power usage for battery improvements.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe design of the MacBook will also be updated, and it will have a thinner, lighter chassis. There will be a keyboard and trackpad as usual, with the touch gestures augmenting existing functionality.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe M6 could be built on TSMC's 2-nanometer process, introducing speed and efficiency improvements for impressive gains in battery life without compromising power. The OLED &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; could also be the first MacBook to incorporate 5G connectivity, with Apple including a C2 chip in the device. The C2 chip is Apple's rumored second-generation in-house modem that will support mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G speeds.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith an OLED display and touchscreen technology, the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; could see a price increase. Apple may also limit the features to higher-end, more expensive models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"m5_imac_timing_and_status_unknown\"><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">M5 iMac</a> (Timing and Status Unknown)</h3>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; could get an M5 chip at some point in 2026, but timing isn't clear.

Max chips are typically reserved for \"Pro\" machines, so it's entirely possible that Apple is planning to launch a new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; Pro at some point in 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/iMac-Pro-Mock-Graphic-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-877852\" />\r<br/>\nNothing else is known about this mysterious &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, and it could also be a machine that Apple uses exclusively for internal testing. If there is a larger-screened &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; in the works, it could feature mini-LED display technology, similar to the rumored Studio Display 2. Sizing is unclear, but it would presumably be larger than the standard 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"mac_pro_timing_unknown\"><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a> (Timing Unknown)</h3>\r<br/>\nApple is probably going to release a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a> at some point, but it's unclear when. <em>Bloomberg</em> originally said a &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/mac-pro-2025-rumors/\">come before the end of 2025</a> with some kind of M4 chip, but that didn't happen, so now 2026 or later is the only option.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Mac-Pro-Feature-Blue.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-880541\" />\r<br/>\nIt's possible the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; will get a refresh with the M5 Ultra chip when the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; does, but we haven't heard confirmation of that and <em>Bloomberg</em> says it's not going to happen. The &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; is reportedly on the back burner at Apple, so no new model could come at all.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf Apple refreshes the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; this year, it will get Thunderbolt 5, and it will likely support at least 512GB RAM and 16TB storage, because that's what the M3 Ultra chip supports.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"home_products\">Home Products</h2>\r<br/>\nWe didn't get a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> in 2025, so those are expected in 2026, plus Apple is working on a new home hub device.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"home_hub_marchapril_2026\"><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/\">Home Hub</a> (March/April 2026)</h3>\r<br/>\nApple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/\">working on a home hub</a> or \"command center\" that will serve as a centralized location for controlling smart home products, listening to music, making video calls, getting the weather, looking things up with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, displaying photos, making notes, viewing calendar events, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/Home-Hub-Command-Center-with-Dome-Base-Siri-Finder-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1014835\" />\r<br/>\nThe device has an all-display design that resembles an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, with a 7-inch display. It's said to be similar in size and shape to two iPhones placed side-by-side, but Apple is designing two variants. The first version is designed to be mounted on a wall, while the second version has a speaker base that looks similar to a &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; and can be placed on a desktop or countertop.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe home hub will have its own operating system, and while there won't be an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, Apple apps will be available as widgets.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBuilt-in sensors will be able to determine when someone is near the home hub, and the features displayed will change based on presence. If no one is by the hub, it might show information like the time and temperature, but if someone approaches, it could shift to an interface for adjusting the temperature.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPresence detection will enable features like turning on the lights when someone enters the room, and it might also be able to tell one person from another. The home hub will play music, and it does have a camera that can be used for video calls.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTouch-based interactions will be available for widgets, but the hub will be heavily reliant on &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; voice commands. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; could have a personified look on the hub, with one design described as a version of the Mac Finder icon.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile screen-based smart home devices like the Echo Show are available for under &#36;200, Apple could price the home hub somewhere around &#36;350. Price could vary for the version with the speaker base and the wall-mounted version without it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is aiming to launch the home hub sometime in the March to April 2026 timeframe.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"homepod_mini_early_2026\"><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> (Early 2026)</h3>\r<br/>\nA new &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is ready to launch, and it could launch in early 2026.

The new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be more similar to ChatGPT or Claude than the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; of today, incorporating large language models to answer complex queries and complete more complicated tasks.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHere's what Apple originally promised &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; would be able to do with &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h4>Personal Context</h4>\r<br/>\nWith personal context, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to keep track of emails, messages, files, photos, and more, learning more about you to help you complete tasks and keep track of what you've been sent.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n <li>Show me the files Eric sent me last week.</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Find the email where Eric mentioned ice skating.</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Find the books that Eric recommended to me.</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Where's the recipe that Eric sent me?</li>\r<br/>\n <li>What's my passport number?</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h4>Onscreen Awareness</h4>\r<br/>\nOnscreen awareness will let &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; see what's on your screen and complete actions involving whatever you're looking at. If someone texts you an address, for example, you can tell &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to add it to their contact card. Or if you're looking at a photo and want to send it to someone, you can ask &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to do it for you.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h4>Deeper App Integration</h4>\r<br/>\nDeeper app integration means that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to do more in and across apps, performing actions and completing tasks that are just not possible with the personal assistant right now. We don't have a full picture of what &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be capable of, but Apple has provided a few examples of what to expect.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n <li>Moving files from one app to another.</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Editing a photo and then sending it to someone.</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Get directions home and share the ETA with Eric.</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Send the email I drafted to Eric.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nThis summer, Apple software engineering chief Craig Federighi said that transitioning &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to new architecture was a success, and that the personal assistant is going to be an even bigger update than expected.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"The work we've done on this end-to-end revamp of ‌&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;‌ has given us the results we needed,\" Federighi told employees. \"This has put us in a position to not just deliver what we announced, but to deliver a much bigger upgrade than that we envisioned.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple decided to use AI technology from Google, so &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will in part be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/05/apple-siri-google-gemini-partnership/\">powered by a Google Gemini model</a> that Google designed for Apple. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be as capable as Gemini since it is using the same underlying technology, but Apple will run the model on its own Private Cloud Compute server with no information provided to Google.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is expected to be ready for an iOS 26.4 update planned for the same March or April timeframe rumored for the home hub.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"ios_27_macos_27_and_more\"><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-27/\">iOS 27, macOS 27 and More</a></h3>\r<br/>\nNew versions of iOS, macOS, and Apple's other software platforms will be previewed in June at WWDC before launching in September. New &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features are expected thanks to the improved &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that Apple will be rolling out in the months ahead of WWDC.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/iOS-27-Mock-Quick.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028322\" />\r<br/>\n&zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; could be used for nutrition planning and medical suggestions, as part of a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/24/apple-health-plus-rumored-to-launch-next-year/\">paid Health+ service</a> that's coming out next year. We don't know specifics yet, but &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features could also expand to additional apps.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith iOS 27, Apple could <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/siri-redesign-report/\">update Siri's design</a>. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will get its major overhaul in iOS 26.4, but a new visual look is supposedly planned for iOS 27. There are no specifics about what the redesign might entail, but rumors linked to Apple's upcoming tabletop robot suggest that the company <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-launching-robot-virtual-companion-in-2027/\">might introduce</a> a version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that's more animated, similar to the Mac Finder logo. That more animated version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; could also come to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is working on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/09/apple-developing-new-satellite-features/\">several new satellite features</a> for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and some of these could come in iOS 27, though timing is unclear.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a> via satellite</li>\r<br/>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> in Messages via satellite</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Satellite API framework for third-party apps</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Satellite over 5G</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Satellite connectivity without the need for a view of the sky.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nSome of these features could require new hardware, but options like &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; via satellite would not require components beyond what's available now.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere will be new iOS 27 features that are designed for the foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, such as interfaces and experiences made for a larger screen.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/23/ios-27-two-key-upgrades/\">has described iOS 27</a> as a \"Snow Leopard\" update, suggesting that Apple will focus on improving underlying performance and quality rather than introducing major new functionality.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"read_more\">Read More</h2>\r<br/>\nMake sure to follow MacRumors.com and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/\">the MacRumors roundups</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/\">guides</a> over the course of 2026 to keep up with all of the rumors we're hearing.

In fact, Apple might be finished with the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-880541\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Mac-Pro-Feature-Blue.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/16/mac-pro-on-back-burner-largely-written-off/\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> recently said that the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; is \"on the back burner\" and has been \"largely written off\" by Apple. Apple apparently views the more compact <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a> as the ideal high-end pro-level desktop, and it has almost replaced the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is working on an M5 Ultra chip that will come out next year, but <em>Bloomberg</em> says the company is only planning to use it in the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, and not in an updated &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;. Apple has no plans to update the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; in 2026 in a \"significant way.\" If we are truly at the end for the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;, will we see Apple discontinue it when the next-generation &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; launches?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe current &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; has a newer, higher-end M3 Ultra chip that supports more CPU cores, more GPU cores, more maximum storage (16TB vs. 8TB), and more maximum unified memory (512GB vs. 192GB). The &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; can support up to four 8K displays, while the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; is limited to three, and the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; doesn't have Thunderbolt 5.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; has fallen behind, and the gap will only increase with the launch of an M5 Ultra &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;. The only benefit that the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; offers over the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; is PCIe expansion slots. It's heavier, bulkier, and more expensive than the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; when comparing equivalent RAM and storage. For most people, there's no reason to choose a &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; over a &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, but some of Apple's high-end customers still need the space for things like RED capture cards and specialized audio interfaces.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOver the years, Apple has struggled with meeting the needs of pro users who want a desktop. The now-infamous \"trash can\" &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; that came out in 2013 prioritized design over functionality, and the machine ended up being a failure. Apple was criticized for misunderstanding its pro user base because there was no space for internal upgrades like additional GPUs.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple was never able to update the trash can &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; because it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/04/04/apple-stresses-commitment-to-pro-users/\">wasn't thermally capable</a> of supporting rapidly evolving GPUs. In 2019, Apple unveiled a modular &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; that had a more traditional enclosure able to support expansion with eight PCIe slots and three impeller fans. Apple did update the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; a couple of times after that, but it has once again been sidelined.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is still selling the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> Ultra version of the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; and it hasn't been discontinued or removed from the company's website. Until it's officially discontinued, there's a chance we could get another &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; at some point in the future, but it doesn't sound like 2026 will be the year. <div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro\">Mac Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1\">Mac Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/31/mac-pro-2026-situation/\">What&#039;s Happening With the Mac Pro?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whats-happening-with-the-mac-pro.2475418/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple plans to enter the foldable smartphone market in September 2026, debuting its first foldable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. We've heard multiple rumors about the design of the upcoming device, but little has been revealed about the operating system or the software features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/iphone-fold-text.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029302\" />\r<br/>\nRumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold will be around 5.4 inches when closed, and approximately 7.6 inches when open, giving it a 4:3 aspect ratio. We did a video featuring a rough &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold mockup at those dimensions yesterday, which provides an idea of what the device will look like.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe title=\"This Is the Closest Look Yet at Apple's Foldable iPhone\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLiz-FQfb2s\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br/>\nWhen unfolded, the upcoming &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will be bigger than any &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to date, and not too far off in size from the original <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>. The current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; has an 8.3-inch screen size, but the first models had a 7.9-inch display.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSince the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold's inner display will be close to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> in size, will it run iOS or iPadOS? Will it work like a standard &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; when the display is closed, and an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; when it's open? Or will it get something in between?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe haven't heard much about iOS 27 as of yet or what Apple has in store for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold, so it's still a mystery. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> says that iOS 27 will lay the foundation for the foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and future foldables, but that's about it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith a larger display, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold will probably support some kind of split screen view or multitasking option, perhaps even adopting Slide Over. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> support for a 7.6-inch display could make sense, but the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold's display will be an awkward middle size between an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. We haven't heard rumors that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold will work with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, but we also haven't heard rumors that it won't.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support could be useful for quick note taking, sketches, signing documents, editing photos and videos, and more. Steve Jobs famously said \"Nobody wants a stylus,\" but in the years since he touted the ergonomics of the finger, the stylus has evolved. The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; isn't one of the tiny plastic pens or imprecise rubber-tipped styluses that were around back in 2007 when Jobs commented on them. It's a writing implement that accurately mimics a pen or a pencil, and it feels natural to use.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSamsung's foldables supported the optional S Pen for many years, but the latest Galaxy Z Fold7 dropped the feature for a thinner and lighter design, which might not bode well for Apple offering the functionality. Rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold is going to be somewhere around 4.5mm thick when unfolded, which will make it thinner than Apple's 5.1mm <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, the thinnest Apple device to date.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSome dedicated Samsung Galaxy Fold users are <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1lvjoae/samsung_dropped_s_pen_support_on_the_galaxy_z/\">unhappy with the feature's removal</a>, so there are definitely foldable smartphone customers out there who like the flexibility of being able to use a stylus. Rumors suggest that Samsung is considering bringing S Pen support back to the next-generation Galaxy Fold, which will, coincidentally, have a shorter, wider design <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/23/samsung-wide-fold-device/\">to match the iPhone Fold</a>. If Apple implements &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support and Samsung doesn't, it's possible Apple will draw some switchers who don't want to use a foldable without a pen option. The opposite is also a possibility, so Apple could lose customers who don't want a foldable without a pen.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGoogle didn't design a stylus for the Pixel Fold, but it did implement support for the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI), so the device works with third-party USI pens. USI pens don't have the same functionality as the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, lacking features like pressure sensitivity, but the basic stylus functionality is there for those who want it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple could do something similar to Google. Add support for the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; for those who want it, without making it a primary marketing point. That would make the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; available for those who want the extra functionality, but it wouldn't be a necessity. Apple could also design an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold-specific &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; that is sized to the device and able to be charged with it, but it all depends on how Apple wants to market the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf it's marketed as an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support is unlikely. Apple has long championed a touch-first approach, and no &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; clearly separates it from the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. If it's marketed as an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; hybrid device, &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support seems like more of a possibility.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple might not be able to implement &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support at all because of technical limitations. Rumors suggest that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold is so thin that it doesn't have the space for the TrueDepth camera hardware for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a>, so Apple is instead adding a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> button to the device. With space at such a premium, a digitizer layer for the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is probably impossible. Apple also needs to take into account how an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; would impact &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold features like the crease in the middle, and that might add too much complication.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEven if the first-generation &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold doesn't get &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support, it could be a feature that Apple adds in the future as display technology improves.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDo you want &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold?

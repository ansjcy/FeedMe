Then, the MacBook Pro is expected to receive a major redesign in late 2026 (but 2027 is still not fully ruled out), with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/22/macbook-pro-six-rumored-features/\">rumored features</a> including an OLED touch screen, a Dynamic Island, M6 Pro and M6 Max chips, a thinner design, and built-in cellular connectivity.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple updated the MacBook Pro twice in one year in the past, with the M2 Pro and M2 Max models debuting in January 2023 and the M3 Pro and M3 Max models following in October 2023, so there is precedent for such a thing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/apple-creator-studio/\">Creator Studio</a> bundle of apps launches on Wednesday, January 28, and it has been speculated that Apple might use the opportunity to unveil the MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips this week.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs for the MacBook Air, it is expected to get the M5 chip, while the Mac Studio should get higher-end M5 Max and M5 Ultra chips.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere have been reports about a new Studio Display being in the works, with rumored features including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/\">mini-LED backlighting</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/\">ProMotion support for up to a 120Hz refresh rate, HDR support, and either an A19</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/a19-pro-chip-coming-to-studio-display-2/\">A19 Pro chip</a>. Last month, the next-generation Studio Display was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/15/new-studio-display-or-pro-display-xdr-filing/\">potentially spotted in a Chinese regulatory database</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple also plans to release a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/five-all-new-apple-products-this-year/\">lower-cost MacBook with an iPhone chip</a> and an updated Mac mini at some point this year, according to Gurman.

      "content": "There has been increasing discussion about Tim Cook eventually stepping down as Apple's CEO, but reports have offered differing timelines.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Tim-Cook-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784461\" />\r<br/>\nA few months ago, the <em>Financial Times</em> reported that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/15/report-tim-cook-to-step-down-as-soon-as-next-year/\">preparing for Cook to step down as soon as early 2026</a>. In his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-25/inside-apple-s-ai-shake-up-ai-safari-and-plans-for-new-siri-in-ios-26-4-ios-27-mktqy7xb\"><em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>, however, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that timeframe \"seems unlikely.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGurman previously <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/23/gurman-on-tim-cook-remaining-apple-ceo/\">said he would be \"shocked\"</a> if Cook stepped down before the middle of 2026, so he might remain CEO through WWDC in June at a minimum.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere has been speculation that Cook might become the chairman of Apple's board of directors after he steps down as CEO, but it seems like that transition will not happen imminently, as Apple's current chairman Arthur D. Levinson is up for re-election at the company's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/08/apple-shareholders-meeting-2026/\">annual shareholders meeting on February 24</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple has a guideline stating that directors generally may not stand for re-election after age 75, but the company asked shareholders to make an exemption for 75-year-old Levinson, due to his significant experience and expertise.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/leadership/john-ternus/\">John Ternus</a>, is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/08/john-ternus-profile/\">widely viewed as Cook's most likely successor</a>. Earlier this week, Gurman reported that Cook <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/22/john-ternus-apple-design-lead/\">gave oversight of Apple's design teams to Ternus</a> at the end of last year, and he said this move makes it \"crystal clear\" that Ternus is the leading CEO candidate.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCook has been Apple's CEO since August 2011, and he reached the typical retirement age of 65 last year. It is sounding more and more likely that his time in charge of the company is inching towards the end, but Gurman seems confident that a passing of the baton is still many months away at least, rather than something that is imminent.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/checkout?id=D28F04\"><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/MacRumors-x-Bloomberg-Banner-Cool.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"559\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007163\" /></a><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/john-ternus/\">John Ternus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/25/when-will-tim-cook-step-down-as-apple-ceo/\">When Will Tim Cook Step Down as Apple CEO?

The highlight this time around is a return of a low price on the 256GB Wi-Fi 11-inch M5 iPad Pro, which is on sale for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0FWD1K669%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>&#36;899.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;999.00.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/m5-ipad-pro.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024421\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

Based on that timeframe, the new-and-improved Siri should be available to all customers with an iPhone 15 Pro or newer in just a few more months.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs previewed by Apple, the assistant \"should be able to tap into personal data and on-screen content to fulfill tasks,\" according to Gurman.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple first announced the more personalized version of Siri all the way back at WWDC 2024, but it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/\">eventually delayed</a>. At the time, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info retrieved from the Mail and Messages apps, as one example of a new capability.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe revamped Siri reportedly experienced issues inside Apple, leading the company <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/google-gemini-future-apple-intelligence-features/\">to turn to Google Gemini</a>. The revamped Siri will technically still run on a new Apple Intelligence model that has Gemini's technology baked in.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSiri will reportedly get even better on iOS 27, as Apple is said to be planning to turn the assistant <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/siri-chatbot-ios-27/\">into a full-out chatbot</a>, allowing users to have sustained, back-and-forth conversations with the assistant. This will essentially turn Siri into ChatGPT or Gemini, except it will be built right into the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, with no app required.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGurman said the Siri chatbot will be \"competitive with Gemini 3,\" and \"significantly more capable\" than the more personalized Siri coming with iOS 26.4.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSiri's chatbot <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/22/apples-siri-chatbot-may-run-on-google-servers/\">might run directly on Google's servers</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/checkout?id=D28F04\"><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/MacRumors-x-Bloomberg-Banner-Cool.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"559\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007163\" /></a><div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/gemini/\">Gemini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/25/siri-google-gemini-release-date/\">Here&#039;s When Apple Plans to Unveil a New Siri Powered by Google Gemini</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-when-apple-plans-to-unveil-a-new-siri-powered-by-google-gemini.2476592/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

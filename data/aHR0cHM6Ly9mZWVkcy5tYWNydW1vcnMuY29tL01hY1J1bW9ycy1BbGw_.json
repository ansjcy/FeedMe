OpenAI CEO Sam Altman declared a \"code red\" on Monday, and told employees that the company needs to improve ChatGPT so it doesn't fall behind competitors like Google and Anthropic.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/chatgpt-logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-998332\" />\r<br/>\nAltman said that OpenAI needs to work on personalization for each user, image generation, and model behavior like speed and reliability.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGoogle <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/18/google-gemini-3/\">debuted Gemini 3 Pro</a> in November, and it outperforms ChatGPT on several benchmarking tests. Google has been luring users with its Nano Banana AI image generator and Anthropic's Claude is popular with business customers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOpenAI's plan to start showing customers ads <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/chatgpt-ads-free-users/\">leaked earlier this week</a>, but Altman told employees that ads are now on the backburner. Work on advertising, shopping AI agents, and a more <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-pulse/\">proactive and personalized version</a> ChatGPT assistant called Pulse has been delayed. OpenAI has been testing several kinds of ads, including ads that would be shown during online shopping requests, but introducing ads could push users to other chatbots.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFollowing the employee memo, <a href=\"https://x.com/nickaturley/status/1995688752178741726?s=20\">ChatGPT lead Nick Turley announced</a> that OpenAI would focus on \"making ChatGPT more capable, continue growing, and expand access around the world -- while making it feel even more intuitive and personal.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOpenAI is not profitable, and it has to rely on its user numbers for investments. If it loses a significant number of users to Google, it could run into financial trouble.<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/chatgpt-logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-998332\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOpenAI will ship a new reasoning model next week, which Altman said is ahead of Gemini 3 in internal evaluations.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/\">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/02/openai-delays-ad-plans/\">Sam Altman Declares &#039;Code Red&#039; for ChatGPT, Delays OpenAI Advertising Plans</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sam-altman-declares-code-red-for-chatgpt-delays-openai-advertising-plans.2473978/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Apple plans to tweak the text and formatting of the ATT consent prompt, while aiming to preserve the main privacy benefits of the feature.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-796491\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ad.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" />\r<br/>\nApple will add neutral consent prompts for its own services and for third-party apps, aligning the wording, content, and visual design of the messages. Apple also plans to simplify the consent process to make it easier for developers to get user permission for ad-related data processing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGermany is asking for feedback from publishers, media groups, and regulators to determine if Apple's changes will address complaints about the limited amount of user data available to app publishers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/23/apple-app-tracking-transparency-europe/\">Earlier this year</a>, Apple said that it might have to remove ATT from the EU. \"Intense lobbying efforts in Germany, Italy and other countries in Europe may force us to withdraw this feature to the detriment of European consumers,\" Apple said.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGermany first launched a probe into App Tracking Transparency in 2022 after complaints from advertisers, and in February 2025, the German Federal Cartel Office preliminarily decided that Apple abused its market power, giving itself preferential treatment. According to German regulators, Apple's restrictions made it \"far more difficult\" for developers to access user data relevant for advertising.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIntroduced in 2021, App Tracking Transparency lets <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> users decide whether to allow apps to track their activity across other apps and websites for advertising purposes. Users can choose to allow apps to ask for permission, or turn off tracking entirely.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nATT prevents apps from accessing the advertising identifier of Apple devices without express consumer permission, so apps can't track what users do and use that data for ad targeting. ATT has been unpopular with advertisers and data brokers, but Apple has pledged to work to convince Germany and other EU countries to allow it to continue to offer ATT to consumers.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-tracking-transparency/\">App Tracking Transparency</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/germany/\">Germany</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/02/germany-app-tracking-transparency/\">Germany Considering Apple&#039;s App Tracking Transparency Changes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/germany-considering-apples-app-tracking-transparency-changes.2473976/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The decision could see Apple facing millions of euros in damages, and it sets a precedent for similar lawsuits in other European countries (via <em><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/eu-court-rules-dutch-courts-can-handle-anti-trust-case-against-apples-app-store-2025-12-02/\">Reuters</a></em>).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Black.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-833990\" />\r<br/>\nApple could ultimately have to pay up to an estimated 637 million euros to address the damage suffered by 14 million <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> users in the Netherlands.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe lawsuit dates back to 2022, when two Dutch consumer foundations (Right to Consumer Justice and &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Claims) accused Apple of abusing its dominant market position and charging developers excessive fees. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Dutch &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; users, and it claimed that Apple's 30 percent commission inflated prices for apps and in-app purchases.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple argued that the Dutch court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case because the EU &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; is run from Ireland, and therefore the claims should be litigated in Ireland. Apple said that if the Dutch court was able to hear the case, it could lead to fragmentation with multiple similar cases across the EU, plus it argued that customers in the Netherlands could have downloaded apps while in other EU member states.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe District Court of Amsterdam ended up asking the CJEU if it had the jurisdiction to hear the case, and the CJEU said yes. The court decided that the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; in question was designed for the Dutch market, and it offers Dutch apps for sale to people with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> associated with the Netherlands, giving Dutch courts jurisdiction.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple told <em>Reuters</em> that it disagrees with the court's ruling, and that it will continue to vigorously defend itself. The District Court of Amsterdam expects to hear the case toward the end of the first quarter of 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe civil &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; fee case that Apple is now facing in the Netherlands is separate from the dating app case that was levied against Apple by ACM, the Dutch competition authority. That case involved regulatory action that led to new alternative purchase options for Dutch dating apps. Apple has also been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/16/court-upholds-case-against-apple/\">fighting that antitrust case</a>, and racked up <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/28/apple-dutch-antitrust-fines-50-million-euros/\">fines of 50 million euros</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">Apple Lawsuits</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/02/dutch-app-store-antitrust-case-proceeds/\">Apple Can&#039;t Escape Dutch App Store Antitrust Lawsuit, EU Court Rules</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-cant-escape-dutch-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit-eu-court-rules.2473971/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Right now, Apple is providing iOS 18 security updates to those who choose to stay on that operating system, but that may stop in the coming months.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAfter pushing people to upgrade to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; by making the option more prominent, Apple will likely remove the option to stay on iOS 18, providing &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; as the only upgrade available on devices that support the newer software. Eventually, customers who want to stay up to date on security fixes will need to transition to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, though Apple will continue to provide iOS 18 updates for devices that do not support &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple hasn't released &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; adoption numbers, so it is unclear how many people have decided to upgrade. Apple typically updates its iOS numbers several months after a new version of iOS launches, so we could get details in January or February.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUpgrading to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; from iOS 18 is irreversible, and Apple does not provide a way to downgrade back to the prior version of iOS.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<em>(Thanks, Nicolás!)</em><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/02/apple-pushes-ios-18-users-to-ios-26/\">Apple Pushes iPhone Users Still on iOS 18 to Upgrade to iOS 26</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pushes-iphone-users-still-on-ios-18-to-upgrade-to-ios-26.2473963/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

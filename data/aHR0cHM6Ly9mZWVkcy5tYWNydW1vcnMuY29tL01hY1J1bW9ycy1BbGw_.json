      "content": "Google today introduced Gemini 3 Pro, its newest and most intelligent AI model. Google says that Gemini offers state-of-the-art reasoning, able to understand depth and nuance. It is also better at understanding the context and intent behind a request for more relevant answers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/google-gemini-3-ai.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2096\" height=\"1178\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027453\" />\r<br/>\nAccording to Google, Gemini 3 Pro is the best model in the world for multimodal understanding, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro on every major AI benchmark. Responses have been designed to be concise and direct, with less flattery. Google claims that it serves as a \"true thought partner.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGemini 3 Pro is rolling out across Google platforms. It's been incorporated into AI mode in Search for Pro and Ultra subscribers, the Gemini app (select Thinking from the model selector), AI Studio, Vertex AI, and Google Antigravity, a new agentic development platform. AI Mode in Search will use Gemini 3 to provide new generative UI experiences like immersive visual layouts and interactive tools generated on the fly.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGoogle AI Ultra subscribers can also use Gemini 3 with Gemini Agent as of today, with Gemini 3 able to execute multi-step workflows from start to finish.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGemini 3 Deep Think is even more intelligent, and Google says that it can solve more complex problems than Gemini 3 Pro. Gemini 3 Deep Think Mode will be available to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the coming weeks.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs part of the Gemini 3 launch, Google redesigned the Gemini app to give it a more modern look. Google says that it's easier to start chats and find images, videos, and reports that you've created in a dedicated My Stuff folder. The shopping experience has been overhauled, incorporating product listings, comparison tables, and prices from Google's Shopping Graph.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are new interfaces, including a visual layout that uses photos and modules, and a dynamic view that uses agentic coding capabilities to create a custom user interface in real-time suited to a query.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/18/google-gemini-3/\">Google Launches More Intelligent Gemini 3 Model</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-launches-more-intelligent-gemini-3-model.2471451/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

In iPadOS 26.2, Slide Over works more like it did before, and there are also useful new options for replacing apps in a tiled view.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen in Windowed or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/stage-manager/\">Stage Manager</a> mode in iPadOS 26.2, you can drag and drop apps into various multitasking views, including Slide Over. Apps can be dragged over from the Dock, Spotlight search, or App Library.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDrag an app to the left or right side of the display to enter a tiled view that's similar to Split View. Drag an app further left or right to establish it as a Slide Over app. There are visual indications that let you know when an app is in a left, right, or Slide Over position.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf you have a Slide Over window open or apps in a tiled view, you can drag another app over the top of the existing one to put the new app in its position. You still can't stack multiple apps up in Slide Over, but at least you can now drag apps into place like you could in iPadOS 18.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/18/ipados-26-2-multitasking-hands-on/\">What&#039;s New With Multitasking in iPadOS 26.2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whats-new-with-multitasking-in-ipados-26-2.2471447/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

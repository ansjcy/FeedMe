      "content": "Back in 2012, an Apple retail employee named Sam Sung went viral because his name is similar to Samsung, one of Apple's main competitors. In a recent interview with <em><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-sung-goes-viral-why-changed-name-after-apple-fame-2025-10\">Business Insider</a></em>, he detailed that period in his life, how Apple responded, and he explained why he ultimately changed his name.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/08/sam_sung_auction.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"716\" height=\"475\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-418827\" />\r<br/>\nSomeone posted an image of Sung's Apple business card on Reddit in 2012, and it spread rapidly. Apple called him and asked him if he was aware of the post, and he became paranoid that he would lose his job.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"I was so scared, and I just wanted to keep my head down and stay employed,\" he said.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAfter a reporter approached him while he was at work, Apple pulled Sung from the store floor, and employees were told not to identify him when customers came in and asked. Apple also took away his business cards. Sung pretended to be someone else when a customer asked, and eventually, the joke died off.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSung ended up leaving Apple in 2013 because he wanted to move on from retail, and in 2014, he ended up <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2014/08/06/apple-sam-sung-auction/\">auctioning off</a> his old business cards and pieces of his former uniform for charity.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSung didn't change his name until after he left Apple, but his decision to do so was a direct result of going viral. He said he \"didn't want to be known for being an internet joke.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHe ultimately decided to change his last name to Struan, which he says is the name of one of his favorite places in Scotland. Though he doesn't regret his name change, he says that he wishes he could tell his younger self to \"see it as a funny thing\" and not stress out about his job.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/22/sam-sung-name-change/\">Former Apple Employee Sam Sung Changed His Name to Avoid Attention</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/former-apple-employee-sam-sung-changed-his-name-to-avoid-attention.2469642/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

CR15 defines the certification program for compliance with the NFC Release 15 specification that was announced earlier this year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/level-lock.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1596\" height=\"898\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-870716\" />\r<br/>\nCR15 allows devices to certify for a read range of up to 20mm, which is a meaningful improvement over the prior 5mm limit. The NFC Forum says that the range increase will improve the user experience by requiring less precise alignment for a connection.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFuture Apple Watch and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models could adopt the increased 20mm range, but existing devices won't benefit because the change requires updated NFC hardware.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch users, the update could allow future Apple devices to activate hotel room doors, house doors, car doors, and other NFC-enabled devices from further away. NFC is used for short-range interactions, like unlocking a HomeKit-compatible door as the homeowner approaches or opening a hotel room door without a physical key. Apple technologies like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> and hotel key wallet integration could be faster and more reliable with the change.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe 15mm increase means users won't have to align devices as precisely, but NFC will still be more secure than longer-range technologies like Bluetooth or Ultra Wideband. Devices that support the 20mm certification could be available in the coming months now that the testing and certification process is available.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple, Google, and other major tech companies are members of the NFC Forum, so Apple was likely involved in the specification upgrade.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/22/nfc-certification-release-15/\">Future iPhones Could Get Extended NFC Range for Easier Tap-to-Unlock</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/future-iphones-could-get-extended-nfc-range-for-easier-tap-to-unlock.2469639/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "summary": "# Bird Buddy蜂鸟喂食器及配件评测\n\n## 引言\nBird Buddy是一家以其配备摄像头的鸟类喂食器而闻名的公司，该产品最初在Kickstarter上推出。自2021年推出初代喂食器以来，Bird Buddy已扩展其产品线，为人们提供了更多将大自然带入生活的方式。本次评测将重新审视Bird Buddy，重点介绍其升级版Pro摄像头、新推出的蜂鸟喂食器以及Nature Station支架。\n\n![Bird Buddy 杆子](https://images.macrumors.com/t/TqLMw_QagBzLSFXbpFQQE9oJFb4=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-pole.jpg?lossy)\n\n## Bird Buddy Pro 摄像头\nBird Buddy Pro是Bird Buddy最新的标准配置，配备了改进的摄像头，支持2K视频、HDR和慢动作视频播放。它拥有更宽广的视野和更好的传感器，HDR功能也是新增的。对于已经拥有Bird Buddy的用户，可以单独购买此摄像头进行升级，因为它与原始摄像头尺寸相同。\n\n*   **外壳与耐用性：** 喂食器外壳由厚塑料制成，可选配太阳能屋顶附件，利用太阳能为摄像头充电。经过一年的风吹日晒、雨淋霜冻，喂食器保持良好状态，仅透明背板略有泛黄，太阳能板顶部偶尔松动，但未出现进水或充电问题。\n*   **充电与续航：** 在每天有少量阳光的区域，Bird Buddy能保持充电状态。但在林木茂盛、阳光不足的地方，需要额外充电。作者认为，太阳能板（额外50美元）物有所值，否则在阴凉处每周需充电一次。\n*   **安装与性能：** 摄像头可轻松安装到喂食器外壳中，通过USB-C线连接到太阳能板。与原始型号相比，Pro摄像头在视频清晰度和细节捕捉方面有显著提升。\n\n![Bird Buddy Pro 摄像头](https://images.macrumors.com/t/iCz07BXCV0Y5SYUIsqMJwJ4yq6c=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-pro-camera.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **视角选择：** Pro摄像头提供特写和广角两种视图选项，解决了鸟类有时在喂食器边缘进食而不在画面内的问题。尽管广角镜头能捕捉到更多画面，作者仍倾向于特写视图。\n*   **局限性：** 摄像头仍需要良好的光线才能拍出清晰照片，在黑暗或逆光环境下表现不佳。但总体而言，Pro摄像头在硬件上优于标准Nature Cam。\n*   **升级建议：** 对于现有Bird Buddy用户，为获得更好的画质，升级Pro摄像头是值得的。\n\n![Bird Buddy 灰猫鸟](https://images.macrumors.com/t/F3tZRmm70I6tlFBgTYCXD2X6Pqk=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-catbird.jpg?lossy)\n\n## Bird Buddy 配件与维护\n\n*   **延长栖木：** 作者购买了延长栖木，并对此感到满意，鸟类经常使用，提供了更多空间。\n*   **其他附件：** 脂肪球和水碗附件因 messy 和占用空间而被移除，作者选择使用独立的解决方案。\n*   **防松鼠：** Bird Buddy并非防松鼠设计。建议将其放置在松鼠无法跳到的地方，或使用鸟类不介意但松鼠讨厌的辣味鸟食。\n*   **鸟类访客：** 喂食器能吸引从哀鸽到雀类等各种大小的鸟类。在没有松鼠偷食的情况下，大约五天需要补充一次鸟食。\n*   **清洁：** 作者每两周清洁一次喂食器，App会发送提醒。清洁过程包括移除残余鸟食、取出摄像头、冲洗、酒精消毒、再次冲洗并晾干。整个过程耗时几分钟，易于操作，有助于预防鸟类疾病。\n*   **安装方式：** 默认配有挂钩，但鸟类可能更喜欢杆式安装的稳定性。Pro摄像头可以在不同的Bird Buddy外壳之间互换使用。\n\n## Bird Buddy 蜂鸟喂食器 Pro\nBird Buddy现已推出蜂鸟喂食器，作者已测试数月。蜂鸟是季节性候鸟（通常在4月/5月至8月/9月出现），因此在考虑购买前需确认所在地区是否有蜂鸟。\n\n![Bird Buddy 蜂鸟喂食器 2](https://images.macrumors.com/t/uM-MQqvjNNTazPZzQ3PokcExAzo=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-hummingbird-feeder-2.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **设计与太阳能：** 蜂鸟喂食器外观与传统喂食器相似，带有红色花形蜜杯。同样可选配太阳能屋顶，但由于蜂鸟的季节性以及需要频繁更换花蜜，其必要性不如标准喂食器高。\n*   **花蜜制作与维护：** 喂食器可容纳1.5杯液体。蜂鸟是喂养成本最低的鸟类，只需用糖和水自制花蜜（建议6汤匙糖兑1.5杯水）。花蜜保质期短，Bird Buddy建议每三天清洁和更换一次，以防发酵。\n\n![Bird Buddy 蜂鸟图片](https://images.rumors.com/t/S0KE4_hPC6fPI8XSQjjuqyc5EcM=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-hummingbird-image.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **使用体验：** 喂食器设计有效，但没有防蚁槽，容易招引蚂蚁。作者所在地区主要吸引红喉蜂鸟，它们具有领地意识。蜂鸟喂食器应放置在有遮蔽且远离大型鸟类喂食器的地方。\n\n![Bird Buddy 蜂鸟喂食器](https://images.macrumors.com/t/FdtPr8xMFDASamM1zONDXN40kDM=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-hummingbird-feeder.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **不足之处：** 挂钩设计不稳固，花朵无法调节角度。作者希望Bird Buddy能提供搭配其他外壳的选项，以便在非蜂鸟季节使用。\n\n![Bird Buddy 蜂鸟喂食器 蜥蜴](https://images.macrumors.com/t/4yTpNPKBx17is0sDZdbndaOtu5M=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-hummingbird-feeder-lizard.jpg?lossy)\n\n## Bird Buddy App\nBird Buddy App是整个系统的核心。摄像头会捕捉鸟类照片，并以“明信片”形式发送到App中。为节省电池，并非每次访问都会记录，App会选择最佳图像和访问。\n\n![Bird Buddy App](https://images.macrumors.com/t/_C7x9SEKGBvs_M3InHE0zdfApAY=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-app.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **免费功能：** 接收明信片和鸟类识别功能是免费的，无需额外付费即可使用核心功能。\n*   **AI识别：** 识别准确率约为80%，有时会出现错误或无法识别。App内有报告错误识别鸟类的功能，有望随着时间推移改进。\n*   **高级订阅（可选）：** 提供额外功能，如与更多人分享直播、解锁2K Ultra分辨率、更多云存储、观看全球更多远程喂食器、命名常客、病鸟提示、与AI聊天获取鸟类信息以及通过iPhone识别鸟类声音等。\n\n## Nature Station 支架\nNature Station是Bird Buddy喂食器及产品的杆式系统，售价349美元，价格昂贵但品质卓越。\n\n![Bird Buddy 杆子 1](https://images.macrumors.com/t/U_dZQJomNOObtJEwvbEnYt67cK4=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-pole-1.jpg?lossy)\n\n*   **耐用性与设计：** 经过六个月的户外使用，支架仍保持崭新，浅蓝色粉末涂层完好无损，在土壤中非常稳固。它有三个落叶松木臂，每个臂可挂多个喂食器，还可添加鸟屋和鸟浴臂。底部可选配一个花盆，用于种植吸引鸟类和蝴蝶的植物。\n*   **防松鼠/浣熊：** 挡板设计有效，松鼠和浣熊无法攀爬，前提是放置在它们无法跳到的地方。\n*   **高度与评价：** Nature Station高约90英寸，可通过移除杆段调节高度。除了价格昂贵外，作者对其性能非常满意，认为它比其拥有的其他杆式系统更坚固、更美观。\n\n![Bird Buddy 杆子 组件](https://images.macrumors.com/t/6Z2Air3Y0MPzVOFYpZ6F8aLt0mo=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-pole-components.jpg?lossy)\n\n![Bird Buddy 杆子 特写](https://images.macrumors.com/t/d9xKqBJ66Vq1qEjejRXInCBdfrQ=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-pole-close-up.jpg?lossy)",
      "shortSummary": "Bird Buddy推出了升级版Pro摄像头、蜂鸟喂食器和Nature Station支架。Pro摄像头提供2K视频、HDR和更广视野，画质显著提升，并支持太阳能充电。蜂鸟喂食器需频繁更换糖水，且有防蚁和挂钩设计问题。Bird Buddy App免费提供鸟类识别和“明信片”功能，但AI识别准确率约80%。Nature Station支架坚固美观，有效防松鼠，但价格较高。整体而言，Bird Buddy产品线扩展，为用户带来更便捷的观鸟体验。",

      "content": "Bird Buddy is a company known for its camera-equipped bird feeder, a product that started out on Kickstarter. Since debuting the original bird feeder in 2021, Bird Buddy has expanded its product lineup, giving people more ways to bring nature indoors.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-pole.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"677\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024231\" />\r<br/>\nI first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/bird-buddy/\">reviewed the Bird Buddy last year</a>, but I am revisiting my review because there's an upgraded camera that's now available, along with a hummingbird feeder and a stand.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Bird Buddy Pro Camera</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Bird Buddy Pro is Bird Buddy's newest standard setup, and it comes with an improved camera that supports 2K video, HDR, and slow-motion video playback. It has a wider field of view, and better sensor, and the HDR is new. If you already have the Bird Buddy like I did, you can buy the camera on a standalone basis, because it is the same size as the original camera and the enclosure is the same.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Bird Buddy enclosure is made from a thick plastic material, and it has an optional solar roof add-on that keeps the camera charged up using the sun. I've had the Bird Buddy up and running for a year now, and it's held up well despite exposure to sun, rain, frost, and heat. The clear back panel that pulls out to clean the Bird Buddy has yellowed a bit, and my solar panel can pop loose a little bit at the top, but I otherwise haven't run into any issues with the integrity of the bird feeder. I'm able to pop the solar panel roof back down, and I haven't had problems with water intrusion or problems with charging.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-pro-camera.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2192\" height=\"1233\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024232\" />\r<br/>\nWhen placed in an area that gets a small amount of sun a day, the Bird Buddy stays charged up, but in a shadier area, I've had to add supplemental charging. Right now, I've got the Bird Buddy in a forested spot next to my house, and it gets little to no direct sunlight. Unsurprisingly, that hasn't been enough to keep the battery charged. Without the solar roof powering the Bird Buddy, it needs to be charged about every week, so I do think the solar panel is worth the extra &#36;50.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"492\" height=\"874\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws3Rfb3Rs7c\" title=\"Bird Buddy Feeder with Pro Camera\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r<br/>\nThe camera pops right into the Bird Buddy enclosure, which is why it was easy for me to swap out the standard camera for the 2K model. The camera connects to the solar panel over USB-C, with the cable tucked away from the elements. Seed goes into the hopper behind the camera, and feeds into the tray where birds sit to eat.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith a better sensor and HDR support, there is a noticeable difference between the newer camera that Bird Buddy offers and the original model. Videos are a lot crisper, and I can see quite a bit more detail in each bird that visits.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-catbird.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1536\" height=\"2048\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024233\" />\r<br/>\nThe Pro camera also has the benefit of having an option for a close-up view or a view with a wider angle, and that solves a problem that I've sometimes had with the Bird Buddy. At times, birds will come to the edge of the Bird Buddy to eat rather than the front and so they can stay out of view. That doesn't happen with the wider-angle lens, though I still tend to prefer the shots that I get with the closer view.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI don't want to give the impression that the camera is perfect, because it still needs good lighting to get crisp shots. In the dark and in situations with odd backlighting or sunlight shining right on the camera, pictures don't come out the best. This isn't a DSLR by any means, but all pictures and videos are an improvement over the standard Nature Cam thanks to the hardware differences, even though the Nature Cam also has 2K video recording as an option and 5-megapixel photos. If you already have a Bird Buddy, enjoy it, and are considering the upgrade, I think it's worthwhile for the better quality pictures.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI bought the extended perch for my Bird Buddy, and I've been happy with it. The birds use it often, and it gives them more space. I also bought the suet ball and water dish add-on, but I've long since removed those. The suet ball was messy and it took up too much space, as did the water dish. I have a different water source for the birds, and I serve suet in a dedicated suet container just so I have less of a mess to clean up.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Bird Buddy is by no means squirrel proof, and if you have local squirrels, they can and will get to it if it's in reach. I've had luck putting it further than a squirrel can jump. Hot seed also seems to be a good deterrent because birds don't mind the pepper taste, but squirrels can't stand it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI've had all kinds of birds come to visit the Bird Buddy, and I sometimes get different visitors depending on what I put out. It can accommodate bigger birds like mourning doves, as well as tiny birds like finches and sparrows.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs long as squirrels aren't stealing food from the Bird Buddy, I can go around five days without needing to refill it. There are people that sell larger hoppers that attach to it, or plenty of 3D files for that purpose if you have a 3D printer. I do wish Bird Buddy sold add-on options like that. Seed is added through a little pulldown at the back of the hopper, and Bird Buddy does include a seed scooper that works well.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI clean the Bird Buddy every couple of weeks, and the app will send reminders to do so. I remove all remaining seed debris, take out the camera, and give everything a good rinse. I then sanitize with alcohol and give it another rinse before letting it dry and filling it back up. It's easy to take apart and clean, and it's a process that takes me only a few minutes. I clean all of my bird feeders regularly just to ensure that I'm not perpetuating any diseases to the local birds, like bird flu. I haven't seen an ill bird at my feeder, but checking on bird health and knowing if a cleaning is needed is one benefit of having a camera.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBy default, the Bird Buddy comes with a hanger. I've used it on a hanger for the last year, but there is an option to purchase a pole mount. I think birds might prefer the stability of a pole mount, but they've still been regularly using it with the hanger even though it wobbles.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith the Pro camera and any Bird Buddy camera, you can pop it out from one enclosure and put it into another. So if you have a Bird Buddy and want to move the camera over to a Hummingbird Feeder, that's possible. The cameras are meant to work with Bird Buddy products, so if you just take it out of the enclosure or try to transfer it to a homemade enclosure, it doesn't work. You can, however, add a magnet to get the camera to function outside of a standard Bird Buddy feeder.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEven after a year, the Bird Buddy works as it did when I first received it. I've continued to use it, and I'm still a fan of it. The Bird Buddy feeders that I've gifted to others are also still in use.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Hummingbird Feeder Pro</h2>\r<br/>\nBird Buddy makes a Hummingbird Feeder now, which I've been testing for a few months. Hummingbird feeders are tricker, because hummingbirds are seasonal birds. You're not going to start seeing them until right around April or May, because they migrate. They'll stick around until August or September, and then they head off again.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-hummingbird-feeder-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024234\" />\r<br/>\nBefore considering a hummingbird feeder of any kind, you need to make sure that you live in an area where hummingbird visits, and <a href=\"https://www.hummingbirdcentral.com/hummingbird-migration-spring-2025-map.htm\">there's a whole website for that</a>. As long as hummingbirds are near you, you can likely attract them to your yard. They're good at spotting anything red, which is why hummingbird feeders are red. The Bird Buddy Hummingbird Feeder looks a lot like traditional hummingbird feeders, and it has the same red flower-shaped nectar cups.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"492\" height=\"874\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j_UcgRQ_lEI\" title=\"Bird Buddy Hummingbird Feeder\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r<br/>\nLike the standard Bird Buddy, the Hummingbird Feeder has a solar roof option. The solar roof is convenient, but because hummingbirds are seasonal and because the hummingbird food needs to be swapped out often, it's not quite as worth the extra cost as the solar panel for the Bird Buddy. It's still a good option if you want to be able to swap food and put the feeder right back out, and it prevents you from needing to pull out the camera to hook it up to a cable.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-hummingbird-image.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024235\" />\r<br/>\nThe Hummingbird Feeder unscrews from the bottom so you can pour sugar water inside, and then it screws back on. The feeder holds 1.5 cups of liquid, which seems about right for hummingbirds. Hummingbirds are probably the cheapest birds to feed, which is a benefit. You just need a big bag of sugar, and then you can make your own nectar. Bird Buddy recommends six tablespoons of water dissolved in 1.5 cups of water. I just make it with hot water from the sink and stir until the sugar is well-dissolved, but you can boil water and it may last a little longer. I don't boil because it changes the concentration of the sugar water mixture.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSugar water doesn't last a particularly long time, so while it's a cheaper feeder to operate, it requires more maintenance. Bird Buddy recommends cleaning and refilling the feeder about every three days, because hummingbirds won't drink sugar water that's started to ferment. If your feeder is in the shade, you might be able to go a little longer, and if it's in hot sun, it might need to be swapped out more often.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-hummingbird-feeder.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024236\" />\r<br/>\nI think the design of the Hummingbird Feeder works, though it does get ants because there isn't an ant moat. Hummingbirds have been using it, but I'm not getting a huge variety because it's mostly ruby-throated hummingbirds in my area, and they're territorial. Hummingbird feeders need to be in an area where the hummingbird has shelter, and it's not recommended to keep them near bird feeders for larger birds. I had mixed luck with hummingbirds in the early months of the year, but as summer turned to fall, visits picked up. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-hummingbird-feeder-lizard.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024237\" />\r<br/>\nMy one complaint about the Hummingbird Feeder is the hook for it. It slots into two divots on the side of the feeder, but it doesn't stay in place, and I always have to fix it. I've also noticed that the flowers are straight down and can't be angled at all, which is different from other hummingbird feeders I've had.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI do wish that Bird Buddy sold the Hummingbird Feeder with another enclosure, because it's not useful for most people several months out of the year. I packed mine up in late September. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Bird Buddy App</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Bird Buddy app is the key part of the Bird Buddy system. The cameras in the bird feeders snap photos that are sent to you as \"postcards\" in the Bird Buddy app. Not every visit is recorded, with Bird Buddy choosing the best images and visits to preserve battery life.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024241\" />\r<br/>\nReceiving postcards from visiting birds is free, as is the identification that the app offers. You can use the Bird Buddy without paying any kind of additional fees for the app.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe app has changed a lot over the last couple of years, and sometimes, I think the addition of new AI features made detection worse. It's accurate about what bird has visited about 80 percent of the time, but the other 20 percent, it can be way off or unable to detect a bird at all. I don't mind too much because I can see what the bird is and I typically know the ones around me, but it can be problematic for people who are trying to use the app to learn more about birds. I do sometimes find myself having to look up a particular bird to figure out what it actually is, but there are in-app features for reporting misidentified birds, so I hope the detection is going to improve over time. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere is a subscription that adds premium features, but it's not mandatory, does not include any of the core features, and it is opt-in.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe subscription lets you share live stream access with more people, it unlocks 2K Ultra resolution, adds more cloud storage, and it lets you watch more remote feeders from around the world. There are also options to name frequent visitors, get tips if you come across a sick bird, chat with AI for bird info, and identify birds by sound with your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Nature Station</h2>\r<br/>\nBird Buddy has a Nature Station, which is basically a pole system for the different Bird Buddy bird feeders and products. It's &#36;349, so it's expensive for a pole, but it is the most premium pole that I've seen.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-pole-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024238\" />\r<br/>\nI've had the Nature Station outside in the full sun and rain for about six months now, and it still looks new. The light blue powder coating hasn't chipped or degraded at all, and it's stable in the soil. There are three larch wood arms with prongs, and each arm can hold multiple feeders. There are also add-on arms for bird houses and the Bird Buddy bath. At the bottom, there's an optional pollinator planter where you can put flowers to attract additional birds and butterflies. I don't have this, but it's essentially just a pot with drainage holes and a slot for the pole to go into.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe baffle design does work, and I haven't had a squirrel that's able to climb it. Squirrels are crafty creatures, so you do need to make sure that it's out of range of anywhere a squirrel can jump from. Raccoons also aren't able to skirt the baffle. The ground stakes are secure, and I've been happy with its performance even in an area that can get fairly wet.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-pole-components.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024239\" />\r<br/>\nThe Nature Station is around 90 inches tall, but if you want it to be shorter you can leave out a pole segment. I don't have anything negative to say about the Nature Station other than pointing out that it's probably more than most people are going to want to pay for a pole system. I have seen some reviews about the plastic arms snapping off, but my review unit did not have those arms so I am unable to comment on them. I just have the three branches, which have worked fine for holding feeders. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/bird-buddy-pole-close-up.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024240\" />\r<br/>\nI have a fairly expensive pole setup from Wild Birds Unlimited as well, and Bird Buddy's version is sturdier and better looking. My Wild Birds Unlimited pole has many of the same components, but the base isn't as stable and I have a harder time keeping it upright.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Upcoming Products</h2>\r<br/>\nBird Buddy recently <a href=\"https://mybirdbuddy.com/birdbuddy-2/\">announced the Bird Buddy 2</a>. It has an upgraded dual solar panel that provides more power, it's faster at detection, it can identify birds with sound, and it holds more seed, so it's definitely worth considering if you're thinking about getting a Bird Buddy. I haven't had a chance to try the Bird Buddy 2 yet, but I'll share a review in the future if I'm able to test it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/wonder-camera-ces-2025.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1124\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-984293\" />\r<br/>\nBird Buddy also has a Bird Bath option that doesn't seem to be widely available yet, and I'm not sure how to get one.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFinally, there's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/29/bird-buddy-wonder-pollinator-system/\">a Kickstarter project</a> for a \"Wonder\" camera that can be put anywhere and can identify bugs, birds, and other critters. It's coming in June 2026. I backed this one, so I should be able to share a review when it comes out.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Bottom Line</h2>\r<br/>\nTwo years in, I still like getting notifications from the Bird Buddy and seeing what birds are coming to the feeder, even if they're the same birds I'm seeing all the time. What visits does change with the seasons, and sometimes I get special visitors that are out of the ordinary.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI have not had issues with the Bird Buddy feeders, and they are still functioning with no issue. The app can be a little hit or miss, but it's still fun to receive bird postcards and browse through my visitors each day. I've bought the Bird Buddy as gifts, and it's still my favorite thing to give people that are hard to shop for. If you don't mind getting into the habit of refilling and maintaining bird feeders, the Bird Buddy is a fun and family friendly way to bring some nature indoors.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>How to Buy</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Bird Buddy Pro and Hummingbird Feeder Pro can be <a href=\"https://mybirdbuddy.com/shop/\">purchased from the Bird Buddy website</a>. The Smart Bird Feeder is &#36;209, while the Hummingbird Feeder is the same price. Solar charging is an additional &#36;50 fee. The Nature Station is &#36;350 and is also <a href=\"https://mybirdbuddy.com/product/bb-nature-station/\">available from the Bird Buddy website</a>. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<em><small>Note: Bird Buddy provided MacRumors with a Hummingbird Feeder Pro and Nature Station for the purpose of this review.

Everything new is inside, and even that's limited.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere's an M5 chip with a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU inside, and it's built on a newer 3-nanometer technology than the equivalent M4 chip in the prior-generation machine.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOn Geekbench 6 tests, the M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; earned a single-core score of 4220 and a multi-core score of 16781, while the &zwnj;M4 MacBook Pro&zwnj; earned a single-core score of 3834 and a multi-core score of 15453. Apple says that M5 CPU speeds are up to 15 percent faster than M4 speeds.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs for the GPU, the M5 earned an OpenCL score of 48101 and a Metal score of 75536, while the M4 earned a score of 38023 and a Metal Score of 57822.

In an interview with <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/transportation/804562/gm-apple-carplay-android-auto-gas-cars-mary-barra\">The Verge</a></em>, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the company opted to prioritize its platform for EVs, but the change will eventually expand across the entire GM portfolio.\r<br/>\n<blockquote>A lot of it depends on when you do an update to that vehicle. When you look at the fact that we have over 40 models across our portfolio, you don't just do this and they all update. As we move forward with each new vehicle and major new vehicle launch, I think you're going to see us consistent on that. We made a decision to prioritize our EV vehicles during this timeframe, and as we go forward, we'll continue across the portfolio.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nWhen asked if users should expect that new gas cars will not support \"smartphone projection\" for &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; or Android Auto, Barra said \"I think that's the right expectation. Yes.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGM Chief Product Officer Sterling Anderson <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/podcast/803379/gm-ceo-mary-barra-sterling-anderson-cadillac-iq-ev-autonomy-interview\">suggested</a> that GM's decision to embrace its own system is a \"very Jobsian approach to things\" that he likened to phasing out the disk drive.\r<br/>\n<blockquote>But frankly, it's a very Jobsian approach to things. The removal of the disk drive, nobody liked that, everybody on the forums and Facebook was complaining about it, but to that he said, \"Look, guys, flash storage really is the future. Get on board, you'll see that.\" That's kind of what we're saying here, in fact that's exactly what we're saying.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nAnderson said that GM's in-house infotainment option offers a \"much more immersive environment\" and can \"do so many more things\" than &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn EVs, General Motors transitioned to an infotainment system that it previously called \"Ultifi.\" GM said that eliminating Apple &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; gave it access to direct integrations and information that it needed for its electric vehicle line, plus the company claimed that an in-house unified solution was the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/gm-further-explains-phasing-out-carplay/\">better option for consumers</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nStarting with the 2028 Cadillac Escalade IQ, GM is rolling out a <a href=\"https://pressroom.gm.com/gmbx/us/en/pressroom/home/news.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2025/oct/1022-SDV-GM-centralized-vehicle-computer-platform-electric-gas-vehicles.html\">centralized vehicle computing system</a> that it says will overhaul how GM vehicles are built and how they can be updated over time.

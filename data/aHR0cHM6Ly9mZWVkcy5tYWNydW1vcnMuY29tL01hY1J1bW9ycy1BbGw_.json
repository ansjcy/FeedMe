      "content": "After a five year wait, Apple finally unveiled <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-announces-new-airtag/\">the next-generation version of the AirTag</a> earlier today. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTag</a> 2 looks exactly like the original &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj;, and the functionality is similar, but there are still some differences worth knowing about.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/Second-Generation-AirTag-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1018\" height=\"572\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1033746\" />\r<br/>\nHere's everything new.\r<br/>\n<ol>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>UWB 2</strong> - The &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2 adopts Apple's second-generation Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Longer Range</strong> - UWB upgrades mean that Precision Finding works from 1.5x further away than before. Precision Finding is the feature that allows an &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; to be precisely located in a close-range indoor area. It is able to lead you directly to the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; with a compatible device.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Precision Finding on Watch</strong> - Precision Finding was previously limited to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, but it now works on the Apple Watch Series 9 and later and Apple Watch Ultra 2 and later, as these devices have UWB chips.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Louder Speaker</strong> - The &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2's speaker is up to 50 percent louder than the speaker in the original &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj;. The upgrade will make it easier to hear when playing a sound, plus it is an additional anti-stalking measure because it will be more difficult for sound to be masked.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Better Bluetooth</strong> - Apple is using a newer Bluetooth specification with increased range.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>New Internal Design</strong> - To accommodate the updated speaker, Apple revamped the internals. Rumors suggested Apple would make it harder to tamper with the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; to remove the speaker, but we'll need to wait for a teardown for confirmation.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Updated Weight</strong> - The &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2 weighs 0.42 ounces or 11.8 grams. it is seven percent heavier than the original &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj;.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Revamped Text</strong> - The text on the back of the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; is now all in capital letters, which is a good way to determine whether an &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; is the first-generation model or the new model. The text also now lists IP67 water and dust resistance, plus it mentions NFC and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a> support. These features aren't new, but aren't listed on the back of the original &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj;.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Still Not For Pets</strong> - Apple's &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2 announcement and product page specifically state that the device is for tracking objects, and not people or pets. Despite this, many people use AirTags for tracking their animals.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Reset Process</strong> - To reset an &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2, you need to remove the battery, leave it out for at least five seconds, and then insert the battery again. The process has to be repeated four times. Apple says that it can take up to 12 seconds to hear the final tone. With the first &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj;, there was no need to wait after removing the battery before reinserting it.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Requires iOS 26.2.1</strong> - If you want to use an &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2, you're going to have to update your device to iOS 26.2.1. The &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2 requires the latest Apple software, which means it won't work with devices that aren't able to run <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>.</li>\r<br/>\n</ol>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2 does everything that the original &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; does, taking advantage of the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network. When the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; is not in Bluetooth range of your own device, it is able to ping Apple devices owned by others to relay its location back to you for long distance tracking.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt also supports Lost Mode, with an NFC feature for discovering who a lost item belongs to, plus it has options for sharing item location with someone else (useful in airports with participating airlines), and it continues to use a CR2032 coin cell battery. Apple says the battery \"works for more than a year\" before needing to be replaced.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2 is still priced at &#36;29, with a pack of four available for &#36;99. Free engraving is also included in the price point. The new &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; can be purchased today, with orders set to be delivered starting on Wednesday, January 28.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airtag/\">AirTag</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/10-things-to-know-about-the-new-airtag-2/\">10+ Things to Know About the New AirTag 2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/10-things-to-know-about-the-new-airtag-2.2476694/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "TikTok last week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-avoids-us-ban-deal-officially-closes/\">finalized a deal</a> to hand over its U.S. operations to a <a href=\"https://usdsjv.tiktok.com\">majority American-owned venture</a>, and things aren't exactly running smoothly for the new U.S. company so far.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tiktok-logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-752609\" />\r<br/>\nOver the weekend, some U.S. TikTok users were unable to upload videos, which TikTok <a href=\"https://x.com/tiktokusdsjv/status/2015807214871535741\">attributed to</a> a power outage at a U.S. data center. TikTok users found they were unable to upload videos related to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Saturday shooting in Minneapolis, leading to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/tiktok-fixed-power-outage-not-censorship-work-views-down-rcna255964\">concerns over censorship</a>. Users saw their videos put into a review process, or experienced fewer than expected video views. Some users received messages that their posts related to the shooting had been flagged as \"Ineligible for Recommendation,\" while others were temporarily suspended.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis evening, TikTok said that it is still working to resolve the infrastructure issue, which apparently caused a \"cascading systems failure\" leading to a long list of bugs. TikTok users may see slower load times, timed-out requests, and 0 views or likes on videos.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe ongoing outage and the accompanying censorship fears have caused some TikTok users <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/867958/tiktok-upscrolled-app-us-takeover\">to abandon the platform</a> for UpScrolled, an alternative video sharing social platform. UpScrolled is currently the number eight free app in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, but it was as <a href=\"https://x.com/realUpScrolled/status/2015890431809032569\">high as number two</a> earlier today.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUsers <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgnj7v2rr5o\">have also expressed concerns</a> about an updated <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/us/privacy-policy/en\">TikTok privacy policy</a> that suggests it collects \"citizenship or immigration status\" along with precise user location information, but the prior TikTok privacy policy <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-users-freak-out-over-apps-immigration-status-collection-heres-what-it-means/\">also included that wording</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe new TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC is 80.1 percent owned by U.S. and global investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX. The three companies each own 15 percent as managing investors, and other U.S. stakeholders include the Dell Family Office and affiliates of Susquehanna International Group. TikTok parent company ByteDance continues to hold a 19.9 percent stake.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA seven-member majority-American board of directors is operating the U.S. version of TikTok, with Adam Presser, TikTok's former global head of operations serving as CEO.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUnder the agreement, the venture handles U.S. data protection, content moderation, and algorithm security. TikTok's recommendation algorithm is being retrained and updated on U.S. user data, and it has been secured in Oracle's cloud environment.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/\">TikTok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-outage-issue/\">TikTok Faces Outage and Censorship Concerns Days After U.S. Ownership Deal Closes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tiktok-faces-outage-and-censorship-concerns-days-after-u-s-ownership-deal-closes.2476691/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5s came out in September 2013, while the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6 launched in September 2014.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAccording to Apple's release notes for the update, iOS 12.5.8 extends the certificate required for features like iMessage, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>, and device activation, so they will continue to work after January 2027.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOriginally, certificate-limited functions like device activation would have ceased when the certificate expired, but now key features on the two older iPhones will continue to work in the years to come.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPrior to now, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5s and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6 last received software updates in January 2023, when Apple released important security fixes.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/apple-iphone-security-updates-five-year-minimum/\">has publicly committed</a> to providing a minimum of five years of security updates for an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from the time that it launches, but it often offers vulnerability fixes for an even longer period of time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6s, for example, was released 11 years ago, but it received a security update in September 2025 with the launch of iOS 15.8.5.

The additional software updates released today should help prevent further issues on other older devices in the future, as well as cellular Apple Watch models. watchOS 26.2.1, also available today, addresses any potential issues with the Apple Watch Series 6 and later. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple says that Australian mobile network operators are continuing to improve support for emergency calling on their networks, which led to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 technical failure. While carriers are working to mitigate further issues, there is a possibility that some older mobile phones might still run into problems.<blockquote>In the rare event that these exceptional circumstances affecting mobile operators' networks were to happen again, some older mobile phones might still encounter the same issue reaching emergency services through an alternate available network.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSoftware updates are available for the following iPhone and Apple Watch models that might be impacted by this network issue. You are encouraged to update your devices to the latest software version.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nApple says that the following iPhones and Apple Watch models should be updated to the latest software version to prevent issues:\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE (1st generation)</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE (2nd generation)</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6 and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6 Plus</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6S and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6S Plus</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 7 and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 7 Plus</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8 and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8 Plus</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS Max</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XR</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11-pro/\">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a></li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12 mini</a>, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a></li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Apple Watch SE 2</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Apple Watch Series 6</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Apple Watch Series 7</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Apple Watch Series 8</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Apple Watch Series 9</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Apple Watch Series 10</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Apple Watch Ultra</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Apple Watch Ultra 2</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nMore information is <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/125851\">available in Apple's support document</a> covering emergency calls in Australia.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/ios-26-2-1-emergency-call-australia/\">iOS 26.2.1 Addresses Emergency Call Problems on Older iPhones in Australia</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-2-1-addresses-emergency-call-problems-on-older-iphones-in-australia.2476688/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "With iOS 26.3, Apple is adding a new \"limit precise location\" setting that reduces the location data available to mobile networks to increase user privacy.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iOS-26-Phone-App-Features.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012692\" />\r<br/>\nMobile networks determine location based on the cellular towers that a device connects to, but with the setting enabled, some of the data typically made available to mobile networks is being restricted. Rather than being able to see location down to a street address, carriers will instead be limited to the neighborhood where a device is located, for example.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAccording to a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/126101\">new support document</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models from supported network providers will offer the limit precise location feature. In the U.S., only Boost Mobile will support the option, but EE and BT will offer support in the UK.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Germany:</strong> Telekom</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> EE, BT</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>United States:</strong> Boost Mobile</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Thailand:</strong> AIS, True</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nThis new location limiting feature also only works with devices equipped with the Apple-designed C1 or C1X modems, which includes the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/\">iPhone Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a>, and cellular M5 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>. iOS 26.3 or iPadOS 26.3 are required. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYou can enable the setting on a compatible device by opening the Settings app, tapping on your cellular service, tapping on Mobile Data Options, and then toggling on Limit Precise Location. You'll need to restart your device when turning the setting on or off. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple says that reducing location precision will not impact signal quality or user experience, and it does not affect the precision of location data provided to emergency responders during an emergency call. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt also only limits the location data available to mobile networks, and it does not have an effect on location data shared with apps through Location Services. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe new feature is available in iOS 26.3, which is being beta tested right now. The iOS 26.3 update will launch to the public in the coming weeks.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/ios-26-3-limit-precise-location/\">iOS 26.3 Adds Privacy Setting to Limit Carrier Location Tracking</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-3-adds-privacy-setting-to-limit-carrier-location-tracking.2476687/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

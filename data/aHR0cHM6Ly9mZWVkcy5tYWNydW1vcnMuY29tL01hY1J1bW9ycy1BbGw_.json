The feature would have provided users with detailed health reports, videos that explained medical conditions and offered wellness tips, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"The major new service would have combined new surveys and health assessments with data from Apple Watches and external lab reports,\" the report added.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt is unclear if Apple Health+ would have been a paid subscription service.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe feature is being scaled back instead of outright canceled.

The device features a 6.1-inch OLED display, an A18 chip, Apple Intelligence, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, an Action button, a USB-C port, and more. The iPhone 17e would be the follow-up, spec-bumped model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAccording to the report, which cites \"reliable sources,\" the iPhone 17e will have a similar overall design as the iPhone 16e. While some previous rumors indicated that the iPhone 17e would have a Dynamic Island, the report said this information is not true and that the device will continue to have a notch like the iPhone 16e.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe publication expects three key upgrades for the iPhone 17e:<ul><li><strong>A19 chip</strong>: This one is no big surprise, but the iPhone 17e is expected to be powered by Apple's A19 chip, up from the A18 chip in the iPhone 16e. This upgrade will result in faster performance and power efficiency improvements.</li>\r<br/>\n  <li><strong>C1X modem</strong>: Apple says its second-generation C1X modem for 5G and LTE is up to twice as fast as its first-generation C1 modem in the iPhone 16e. Apple also says the C1X is the most power-efficient modem in an iPhone to date.</li>\r<br/>\n<li><strong>N1 chip</strong>: Like the iPhone Air, the report said the iPhone 17e will be equipped with Apple's N1 chip for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Thread. In the iPhone Air, the N1 chip supports Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6, and Apple says the chip improves the overall performance and reliability of features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop.</ul>As for the iPad 12, the report said that device will likely have a similar design as the iPad 11, but with a newer A18 chip that supports Apple Intelligence. That means the iPad 12 would have 8GB of RAM, up from 6GB in the iPad 11.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iPad-A16-Colors.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-992621\" />\r<br/>\nA separate report <a href=\"https://www.macwelt.de/article/3051931/iphone-17e-19-februar-leak.html\">from <em>Macwelt</em></a>, available <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3052191/iphone-17e-set-to-launch-on-19-february-only-one-camera-but-finally-magsafe.html\">in English on <em>Macworld</em></a>, cites a source who said that Apple plans to announce the iPhone 17e with a press release on an unusual date: Thursday, February 19. The publication agreed that the iPhone 17e will not have a Dynamic Island, but they do expect the device to feature MagSafe, as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/iphone-17e-rumored-to-fix-iphone-16e-limitation/\">previously rumored</a>.<ul>\r<br/>\n  <li><strong>MagSafe</strong>: Unlike the iPhone 16e, the iPhone 17e will reportedly feature MagSafe for up to 20W-25W magnetic wireless charging. The iPhone 16e is limited to Qi wireless charging at up to 7.5W speeds. You would also be able to magnetically attach accessories like Apple's MagSafe Wallet to the back of the iPhone 17e.</li></ul><em>Macwelt</em> added that the iPhone 17e will still have a single rear camera.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple announced the iPhone 16e on Wednesday, February 19 last year, so the iPhone 17e would be unveiled exactly one year later if this rumor is accurate. It is quite uncommon for Apple to unveil new products on a Thursday, but anything is possible.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNo other major changes have been rumored so far, so the iPhone 17e's overall design and other specs should be similar to the iPhone 16e. In the U.S., the iPhone 16e starts at &#36;599, but there is no word yet on how much the iPhone 17e will cost.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macotakara-jp/\">Mac Otakara</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macwelt/\">Macwelt</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macworld-com/\">Macworld</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/05/iphone-17e-and-ipad-12-rumors/\">iPhone 17e and iPad 12 Features and Release Date Rumors Surface in Two New Reports</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17e-and-ipad-12-features-and-release-date-rumors-surface-in-two-new-reports.2477243/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

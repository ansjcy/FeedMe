OpenAI started testing group chats with a small number of people last week, but the feedback was positive so it is now expanding the feature to everyone.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/openai-chatgpt-group-chats.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027790\" />\r<br/>\nWith group chats, ChatGPT users can create a shared conversation space and invite friends, family, or coworkers. Group chats are separate from private conversations, and OpenAI says that the group creator's personal ChatGPT memory is never shared with anyone in the chat.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAccording to OpenAI, group chats can be useful for planning a weekend trip with friends, designing a backyard garden, collaborating on design ideas, finding a restaurant that suits everyone's tastes, or settling debates. Group chats can also be used for research for school or work projects, incorporating shared articles, notes, and questions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCreating a group chat can be done by tapping on the people icon in the top right corner of any new or existing chat. People can be invited by sharing a link, and anyone with the link can invite more people, with up to 20 supported. Group chats are aggregated in a clearly-labeled section of the sidebar, separate from personal chats.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOpenAI says ChatGPT was taught new social behaviors for group chats. It follows the flow of conversation and decides when to respond and when to stay quiet based on the context of the conversation. Mentioning ChatGPT in a message will prompt it to respond, and ChatGPT can react to messages with emojis.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGroup chats are available to all logged-in users on free, Go, Plus, and Pro ChatGPT plans. OpenAI says that it will continue to refine the feature as more people start using it.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/20/chatgpt-group-chats/\">ChatGPT Group Chats Now Available Worldwide</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chatgpt-group-chats-now-available-worldwide.2471610/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Nano Banana Pro is built on Gemini 3 Pro, Google's latest and most advanced AI model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe title=\"Nano Banana Pro: Your new creative partner\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UQsJIo46ZR8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r<br/>\nGoogle says that Nano Banana Pro is the best model for generating images with correctly rendered and legible text, from a short tagline to a long paragraph. Nano Banana Pro's text expertise allows for the creation of mockups and posters with different fonts, textures, and word style, plus it works in multiple languages.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nContent is more helpful than before, with Nano Banana Pro able to create text-heavy infographics and diagrams for learning purposes. It can connect to Google Search to gather information for a graphic, and blend more elements than before. It supports uploading up to 14 images and can maintain the consistency and resemblance of up to five people.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are image editing tools in Nano Banana Pro that can be used to select, refine, and transform parts of images with localized editing. Camera angles, focus, color, and lighting can be adjusted, and there are 2K and 4K resolution output options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith the launch of Nano Banana Pro, Google is giving Gemini the ability to tell if an image was generated with Google AI. AI-created images feature SynthIDs and a visible watermark on images generated by free and AI Pro tier users.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNano Banana Pro is available in the Gemini app when using the Create images feature with the Thinking model. Free users will receive limited quotas, and then will revert to the original Nano Banana model. Google AI Plus, Pro, and Ultra subscribers can generate more images before hitting the limit. Nano Banana Pro is also available for Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in AI mode in Search.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGoogle is making Nano Banana Pro available for companies that use Google Ads, and developers can use it through the Gemini API and Google AI Studio.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/20/google-launches-nano-banana-pro/\">Google Launches Nano Banana Pro AI Image Generator With Improved Text Capabilities</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-launches-nano-banana-pro-ai-image-generator-with-improved-text-capabilities.2471608/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Earlier today, Google <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/20/iphone-android-airdrop-quickshare/\">made a surprise announcement</a> that the Quick Share file transfer feature on Pixel 10 smartphones was able to work with AirDrop, enabling first-party file sharing between Android devices and Apple devices.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/android-iphone-airdrop-quickshare.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1353\" height=\"761\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027746\" />\r<br/>\nTypically, Apple and Google work together on cross-platform features, but it turns out that Apple had no involvement this time. Google created the Quick Share to AirDrop interoperability on its own, and apparently sprung it on Apple with a public announcement. From a statement Google provided to <em><a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/quick-share-airdrop-compatible-without-apple-3618067/\">Android Authority</a></em>:\r<br/>\n<blockquote>We accomplished this through our own implementation. Our implementation was thoroughly vetted by our own privacy and security teams, and we also engaged a third party security firm to pentest the solution.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nIt's possible that Google gave Apple a heads up about its plan to devise an Android and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> file transfer solution, but Apple's total lack of participation in the announcement suggests that Apple wasn't interested in working with Google to develop it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGoogle says that it is using its own implementation, and Apple's take on that is unclear. Apple has not historically supported third-party workarounds for interoperability between &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Android devices, and it continually worked <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/08/beeper-mini-imessage-for-android-shutdown/\">to put a stop</a> to an iMessage for Android feature that Beeper attempted in 2023.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Beeper situation does seem to have some parallels with Google's AirDrop move. Beeper reverse engineered Apple's iMessage protocols and encryption, using Apple's iMessage servers to allow Android users to send blue bubble messages to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users. Apple was able to successfully shut down Beeper's messaging solution.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGoogle is a much bigger company than Beeper, and now that it has publicly announced and launched the Quick Share to AirDrop functionality, it would be harder for Apple to oppose it. Apple is also facing more intense regulatory pressure than it was even two years ago, so it might not want to kill the cross-platform file sharing feature.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFile sharing was implemented with an interoperability layer between Quick Share and AirDrop that uses the Rust programming language, according to Google.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGoogle claims that it had a third-party pentest the security of the file sharing protocol, and that it worked to vet the solution with its own privacy and security teams. Google accompanied the announcement with <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2025/11/android-quick-share-support-for-airdrop-security.html\">a full blog post</a> on the underlying security. Apple hasn't commented yet.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple and Google have previously worked together on several cross-platform features, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/\">RCS</a> messaging, unknown tracker identification and alerts, and SIM transfers.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/20/google-iphone-airdrop-surprise/\">Will Apple Kill Google&#039;s Surprise Android to iPhone AirDrop Interoperability?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-apple-kill-googles-surprise-android-to-iphone-airdrop-interoperability.2471604/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The feature is available in the Health app on all iPhone models compatible with iOS 26, and in the Sleep app on all Apple Watch models compatible with watchOS 26.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Alarms for Reminders</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-alarm-reminders.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025665\" />\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 lets you <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/04/ios-26-2-alarms-reminders-app/\">set alarms for reminders</a> in Apple's Reminders app.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen adding a reminder, selecting a time and then toggling on the \"Urgent\" option will cause an alarm to go off at the designated time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Apple Podcasts Enhancements</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/Apple-Podcasts-Chapters.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1300\" height=\"780\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026459\" />\r<br/>\nApple's Podcasts app has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/04/ios-26-2-podcasts-app-update/\">three new features on iOS 26.2</a>, including automatic chapters for episodes, timed links on the screen, and the ability to view other podcasts that a podcast mentions right from the audio player and the transcript.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Apple News Revamp</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-apple-news-update.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025698\" />\r<br/>\nIn the Apple News app, there is now a dedicated \"Following\" tab, and buttons for quick access to topics like sports, puzzles, politics, business, and food.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>iPhone Screen Flash for Notifications</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-flash-alert.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025699\" />\r<br/>\nStarting with iOS 26.2, your iPhone's screen can flash when you receive a notification. Previously, this setting was limited to the LED camera flash on the back of the iPhone.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn the Settings app, under Accessibility → Audio & Visual → Flash for Alerts, there are now options for LED Flash, Screen, and Both. Or, you can keep the setting turned off.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>AirPods Live Translation in EU</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/AirPods-Live-Translation.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025657\" />\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 makes Live Translation on AirPods <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ie/newsroom/2025/11/live-translation-on-airpods-expands-to-the-eu/\">available in the EU</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLive Translation allows you to understand someone who is speaking a different language than you. For example, if you speak English, and someone is speaking to you in French, Siri can tell you what they are saying in English through your AirPods.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe feature works best when both participants in a conversation are using Live Translation on AirPods. If you are talking with someone who is not wearing AirPods, you can display a live transcription in the other person's language on your iPhone.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLive Translation is available on the AirPods Pro 3, AirPods Pro 2, and higher-end AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation. The feature launched in the U.S. and select other countries with iOS 26, but it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/11/airpods-live-translation-eu-restricted/\">not available in the EU</a> until iOS 26.2, as Apple said it needed additional time to ensure compliance with the EU's Digital Markets Act.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-26-use-live-translation-with-airpods/\">iOS 26: Use Live Translation With AirPods</a></li></ul>\r<br/>\nIn addition to compatible AirPods, users need an iPhone 15 Pro or newer with Apple Intelligence turned on and Apple's Translate app installed.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs of iOS 26.1, Live Translation on AirPods supports the following languages:<ul>\r<br/>\n  <li>English (U.S.)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>English (U.K.)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>French (France)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>German (Germany)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Portuguese (Brazil)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Spanish (Spain)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Chinese — Simplified (China)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Chinese — Traditional (China)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Japanese</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Korean</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Italian</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>iOS 26 also has a built-in Live Translation feature in the Messages, Phone, and FaceTime apps, with no AirPods required.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/20/ios-26-2-new-features/\">iOS 26.2 Adds These New Features to Your iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-2-adds-these-new-features-to-your-iphone.2471601/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

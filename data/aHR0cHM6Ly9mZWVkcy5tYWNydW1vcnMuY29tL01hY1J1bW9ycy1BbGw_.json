The \"TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC\" that includes the three companies will own 45 percent of TikTok, while ByteDance will keep close to 20 percent. Existing investors will continue to hold the remaining shares.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tiktok-logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-752609\" />\r<br/>\nThe U.S. group will handle U.S. data protection and content moderation, while also maintaining algorithm security. It has been tasked with retraining the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data to \"ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation.\" Oracle will be in charge of auditing and validating compliance with National Security Terms.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe agreement states that the USDS Joint Venture will \"operate as an independent entity\" that has authority over U.S. data protection, while TikTok's global U.S. entities will manage global product interoperability along with e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith the sale, TikTok will be able to continue operating in the United States while complying with the 2024 Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. The act required TikTok parent company ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations to a non-Chinese company or be banned from operating in the United States.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTikTok was briefly banned in January, but Donald Trump signed an executive order granting an extension that brought it back. The ban has been extended multiple times since then to provide additional time for a deal to be established.

      "content": "<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a> is not going to bring Fortnite to iOS in Japan as promised because of the fees imposed by Apple's new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> rules, &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; CEO Tim Sweeney <a href=\"https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2001494522300137865?s=20\">said on social media</a>. Sweeney complained that Apple did not comply with Japan's Mobile Software Competition Act \"honestly\" and instead \"launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/fortnite-apple-logo-2.5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-756080\" />\r<br/>\nBack in 2024 when the MSCA passed, Sweeney said that Epic would launch Fortnite in Japan in late 2025. He made the announcement before he was aware of how Apple planned to comply with the MSCA.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSweeney accused Apple of charging \"competition-crushing\" junk fees, including a five percent fee on revenue from apps distributed through alternate app marketplaces. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; would need to pay Apple a five percent fee on all revenue generated via game purchases made through an &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Store in Japan, or 15 percent on digital purchases through a web link if the Fortnite app were to be distributed through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n<blockquote>Obviously, real competition won't happen, and consumers won't benefit, when Apple abuses its position between users and competitors to obstruct honest dealing between them. This is another sad day in the history of relationships between platform makers, developers, and consumers, and we will be raising our complaints with the Japanese Fair Trade Commission.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nSweeney said that &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; plans to raise complaints with the Japanese Fair Trade Commission.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple says that it worked with Japanese regulators when establishing its new rules to comply with the MSCA, so it is not clear if &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; will be able to persuade Japan to implement more stringent restrictions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nJapan's rules allow Apple to be compensated for its intellectual property, and Japan's interoperability rules allow Apple to refuse requests in situations where privacy and security would be compromised. Along with allowing for alternative app marketplaces, the MSCA adds support for alternate payment methods and allows Japanese users to set new functionality for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s Side Button.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; was able to bring the &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Store to the European Union, but Apple does have a 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee for marketplaces there, too. The Core Technology Fee will transition to a five percent Core Technology Commission for all developers in the EU starting on January 1, 2026, so the fees will be very similar to the Japan fees.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fortnite/\">Fortnite</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/japan/\">Japan</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/18/fortnite-japan-fee-complaints/\">Fortnite Not Coming to iOS in Japan as Epic Games CEO Accuses Apple of &#039;Obstruction and Lawbreaking&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/fortnite-not-coming-to-ios-in-japan-as-epic-games-ceo-accuses-apple-of-obstruction-and-lawbreaking.2474950/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

There <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/256138209\">are also complaints</a> from users who have other kinds of displays, so it might be a bug that is affecting more than one type of external monitor.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe have experienced this issue with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> running macOS Tahoe connected to a Studio Display, and the macOS Tahoe 26.1 and macOS Tahoe 26.2 updates haven't improved the situation at all. In fact, the flickering seems to be getting worse in recent days.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFlickering happens most often when switching between apps that feature stark white backgrounds, or scrolling through webpages on light backgrounds. Any app can cause the flickering, and sometimes it just seems to be random. When flickering occurs, it's typically a brief flicker, but the display can also flicker several times in a row for a few seconds at a time. Switching from dark content to light content can almost always trigger a flicker on affected machines.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt's not clear what is causing the issue, but given that multiple Studio Display owners are experiencing it, it's likely some kind of software issue that could be addressed with new Studio Display firmware rather than a hardware problem.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/\">macOS Tahoe 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-tahoe.250\">macOS Tahoe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/18/macos-tahoe-studio-display-flickering/\">macOS Tahoe Bug Causes Studio Display Flickering Issues</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-tahoe-bug-causes-studio-display-flickering-issues.2474942/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Prospective AltStore users need to be physically located in Japan, and have a Japanese &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; account. Devices also need to be running iOS 26.2 or later.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAltStore developer Riley Testut said that Apple did not provide a heads up about the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rule changes that went into effect yesterday, but the marketplace was able to launch within a few hours because it has been live in the European Union for months now.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTo celebrate AltStore PAL's launch in Japan, users can get a month of free Patreon access with patron-exclusive features. AltStore is free to download, but the AltStore Patreon provides access to beta updates for the popular Delta game emulator.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlong with Delta, AltStore PAL offers several other apps created by independent developers, some of which have functionality that's not allowed in the standard &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Apps distributed through AltStore PAL are able to monetize through Patreon subscriptions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is allowing alternative app marketplaces to meet the requirements of the Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA) that went into effect on December 18. Marketplace apps are required to pay Apple a five percent Core Technology Commission.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlternative app marketplaces require authorization from Apple to operate, and are able to distribute apps that have also been notarized by Apple. The notarization process checks for basic functionality and ensures that apps do not include malware, but marketplace apps are not subject to the same content requirements, and Apple has little content oversight.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/altstore/\">AltStore</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/japan/\">Japan</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/18/altstore-japan-launch/\">AltStore Available in Japan One Day After Apple Enables Alternative App Marketplaces</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/altstore-available-in-japan-one-day-after-apple-enables-alternative-app-marketplaces.2474939/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

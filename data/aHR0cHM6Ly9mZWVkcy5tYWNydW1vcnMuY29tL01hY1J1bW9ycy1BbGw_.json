      "content": "Apple continued to keep users waiting for new hardware this week, as we've yet to see any of the significant product launches we're expecting to see in the first few months of the year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/top-stories-2026-02-14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036213\" />\r<br/>\nNews on the software side was a bit of a mixed bag this week, with iOS 26.3 and other updates finally seeing their public releases, though they mainly focus on security fixes with only a few user-facing changes. And the highly anticipated iOS 26.4 coming up next might not arrive with everything many users have been hoping for, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Top Stories</h2>\r<br/>\n<h3>iOS 26.3 Features: Everything New in iOS 26.3</h3>\r<br/>\nAfter almost two months of beta testing, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/apple-releases-ios-26-3-and-ipados-26-3/\">finally released iOS 26.3</a> and related updates to the public this week.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/iOS-26.3-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029939\" />\r<br/>\nAs is common for x.3 updates, the changes in these are relatively modest, though <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-3-features/\">there are a number of security improvements and a few new features</a> like a tool to make it easier to transfer from an iPhone to an Android phone, some changes to Weather wallpapers, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>New Siri Runs Into Problems, Features Could Be Pushed to iOS 26.5 and iOS 27</h3>\r<br/>\nWith iOS 26.3 out the door, the first beta of iOS 26.4 should be arriving soon, but it might come with a catch. While we've been expecting iOS 26.4 to include significant improvements to Siri with a new, more personalized experience, it now sounds like we might not be getting that until iOS 26.5 or even iOS 27.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Sad-Siri-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-994723\" />\r<br/>\nAccording to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/siri-features-delayed-ios-26-4/\">Apple has \"run into snags\" in just the past few weeks</a> as it has been testing the new Siri, and recent internal betas are suggesting Apple is moving many of the new capabilities from iOS 26.4 to iOS 26.5.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Stores See iPhone 16e, iPad Air Shortages as New Models Near</h3>\r<br/>\nWe're expecting a few Apple hardware releases in the relatively near future, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/12/apple-stores-iphone-16e-ipad-air-shortages/\">Apple retail store shortages of iPhone 16e and iPad Air models</a> lining up with circulating rumors may hint at those products being very close to receiving updates.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-16e-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-990895\" />\r<br/>\nThe new iPhone 17e in particular <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/iphone-17e-launch-imminent-with-four-features/\">has been viewed as \"imminent,\"</a> and it should bring several improvements over the iPhone 16e, including support for MagSafe charging.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Why You Shouldn't Buy the Next MacBook Pro</h3>\r<br/>\nWhile the entry-level MacBook Pro was updated with the M5 chip last October, we're still waiting for higher-end machines with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/m5-macbook-pro-deal.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025807\" />\r<br/>\nThose new models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/new-macbook-pros-could-now-arrive-in-march/\">should be arriving shortly</a>, but if you're interested in cutting-edge technology, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/10/macbook-pro-buying-advice-2026/\">you might want to give those machines a skip</a>. The M5 Pro and M5 Max models will largely just be speed-bumped versions of the current generation, but there's a major revamp coming as soon as later this year with an all-new design, OLED displays with touchscreen capabilities, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Expected to Launch These 10+ Products Over the Coming Months</h3>\r<br/>\nWhile the iPhone 17e and updated iPad Air appear imminent with new MacBook Pro models not far behind, Apple has even more in its near-term pipeline with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/10/new-apple-products-in-coming-months/\">at least ten new products expected over the next few months</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/Apple-Logo-Black.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1145\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034439\" />\r<br/>\nMany of these are iterative updates to existing products, but we're expecting a few all-new ones in the mix as well. Potential delays to the revamped Siri may impact timing of some of them including the new smart home hub and ecosystem, so we'll have to wait to see how that timing plays out.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>iPhone 18 Pro Max Rumored to Deliver Next-Level Battery Life</h3>\r<br/>\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max is already a battery life king, but the upcoming iPhone 18 Pro Max could take things even further if a known leaker is correct. A recent report claims Apple will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/06/iphone-18-pro-max-next-level-battery-life/\">trying to cram a bit more battery capacity into this year's larger Pro model</a>, pushing it up to 5,100 to 5,200 mAh.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iphone-17-pro-dark-blue-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2091\" height=\"1176\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020948\" />\r<br/>\nApple is reportedly also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/07/two-major-iphone-18-pro-camera-upgrades/\">working to implement a couple of camera improvements</a> on this year's iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max, including a variable aperture on the main camera and a wider fixed aperture on the telephoto camera.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThese potential improvements come as Apple is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/10/iphone-18-pro-pricing-estimate/\">seeking to hold the line on pricing</a> despite significant cost increases for certain key components.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>MacRumors Newsletter</h2>\r<br/>\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/feb-12-2026\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/14/top-stories-ios-26-3-released/\">Top Stories: iOS 26.3 Released, New Siri Snags, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-ios-26-3-released-new-siri-snags-and-more.2477696/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple has a long list of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/upcoming-apple-products/\">new products rumored for 2026</a>, including a series of home products that will see the company establishing more of a presence in the smart home space. Robots are on the horizon for 2027, but the 2026 releases will be a little tamer.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/iOS-26-Home-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034994\" />\r<br/>\n<h2>HomePod mini</h2>\r<br/>\nWe're expecting a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> 2 to launch at any time. Apple isn't going to update the device's design, but we could get new colors. The &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; 2 will have an updated S-series chip based on the Apple Watch Series 10 chip, and there's a possibility for sound improvements and improved real-time computational audio. Apple will also likely upgrade to Bluetooth 5.3 for connectivity improvements, and it could get a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe current &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is &#36;99, and that's not expected to change. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Home Hub</h2>\r<br/>\nApple has been working on a home hub that will serve as a centralized location for all members of the family to control smart home devices, make calls, listen to music, get information like the weather, use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, view photos, see a family calendar, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRumors suggest the home hub will have presence sensors to detect when someone is in the room, and an included camera could be able to tell who is speaking to it so that it can pop up a personalized selection of apps and features for each user.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe home hub is expected to have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a>, built-in speakers, and support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> thanks to an A18 chip. While there won't be a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, the home hub will run Apple apps like Safari, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, Notes, Calendar, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news/\">Apple News</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are two separate models, including one that's designed to be mounted on the wall and one that has a speaker base that looks like a &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Security Camera and Doorbell Camera</h2>\r<br/>\nApple is designing its own <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-home-security-camera/\">indoor security cameras</a> that will connect to Apple Home and interface with the home hub. We've also heard rumors of a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/22/apple-doorbell-with-face-id-rumor/\">potential doorbell camera</a> with &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; that would be able to connect to a door lock. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAny Apple-designed cameras will feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit-secure-video/\">HomeKit Secure Video</a> with end-to-end encryption, but little else is known at this time. There has been mixed information on when we might see Apple's security cameras, but they could come as early as 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Launch Timing</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; and home hub are expected early in the year, likely before WWDC. The cameras, if we get them in 2026, will likely come late in the year. Prior rumors suggested that Apple would release the home hub around the time that the new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; launches. The smarter &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; was expected in iOS 26.4, but it may now be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/siri-features-delayed-ios-26-4/\">pushed back to iOS 26.5</a>. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Read More</h2>\r<br/>\nFor more on what to expect from Apple in 2026, we have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/upcoming-apple-products/\">a dedicated Apple Products guide</a> that lists all of the devices on the horizon. We update it regularly, so it's a useful guide to bookmark and check every now and then to keep up to date with Apple's plans.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/apple-home-2026-rumors/\">Three New Apple Home Products Rumored for 2026</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/three-new-apple-home-products-rumored-for-2026.2477677/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "With the launch of the Creator Studio subscription app offering, Apple may be phasing out the iWork branding that it has used since 2005 for Pages, Keynote, and Numbers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iWork-macOS-Trio-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-818315\" />\r<br/>\nApple today <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/iwork/\">removed the iWork section</a> on its website, and the URL now redirects to a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apps/\">more generic \"apps\" page</a> that features Creator Studio, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a>, Apple Invites, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/\">Image Playground</a>, and other Apple apps.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe iWork page that Apple removed was dedicated solely to Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, featuring information on each app along with a link. Apple's apps page offers some of the same information in a dedicated productivity section, but with additional details on the premium features included in Pages, Numbers, and Keynote with Apple Creator Studio.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apps/\">apps page</a> does not mention the iWork branding at all, suggesting that Apple is no longer referring to the three productivity apps using that term and is instead going to advertise them as Apple Creator Studio apps.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/apple-iwork-page.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1378\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036370\" /><em>Apple's now-removed iWork page</em></div>\r<br/>\nIt's not clear if Apple is going to phase out \"iWork\" entirely, and the term is still used across different <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/imac/design-with-iwork-apd8b783ddd6/mac\">support documents and guides</a>. It may take time to completely eliminate the all-in-one branding that Apple has used for Pages, Numbers, and Keynote for more than 20 years, or it could still be used in some limited situations.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple introduced Keynote as a standalone app in 2003, and added Pages in January 2004. A year later, both apps were bundled together under the iWork '05 name, with the software priced at &#36;79. Apple said iWork was a successor to AppleWorks, an office suite that included a word processing app, a database, a drawing app, and a spreadsheet app. The iWork apps were designed from the ground up, and were essentially the Mac equivalent to Microsoft Office.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn 2007, iWork '08 gained the Numbers app, and in 2009, iWork '09 included an iWork.com service for sharing documents online (discontinued in 2012 in favor of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a>). When iWork '09 came out, Apple started selling the apps for &#36;20 each, later adding them to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-app-store/\">Mac App Store</a> when it launched in 2011. iOS versions of the iWork apps came in 2010 with the launch of the first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, with Apple charging &#36;9.99 each.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple redesigned the iWork apps for Mac and iOS in 2013, and started offering them for free to Mac buyers. Pages, Keynote, and Numbers remain free today, though there are now upgraded features accessible only through the Apple Creator Studio subscription.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple Creator Studio is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/28/apple-creator-studio-now-available/\">priced at &#36;12.99 per month</a>, and in addition to the iWork apps, it includes access to Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage. For Numbers, Pages, and Keynote, Apple Creator Studio adds a content hub with Apple-curated royalty-free photos, premium templates, and themes. There's also a tool to remix image creations right in a document, and a Super Resolution tool for upscaling images.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn addition to iWork, Apple has been phasing out other \"i\" branding terms over the last several years. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ibooks/\">iBooks</a> and iPhoto are now Apple Books and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a>, respectively, while iTunes has been separated into <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/\">Apple Podcasts</a>. Apple still uses \"i\" branding for iMovie, &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>. <div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iwork/\">iWork</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/apple-iwork-website-removed/\">Is Apple Phasing Out the iWork Brand?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/is-apple-phasing-out-the-iwork-brand.2477675/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

For example, there are articles and videos highlighting everything from reasons to upgrade to a newer iPhone to popular iPad features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is aiming to release the \"Sales Coach\" app on Monday, February 23, our source said. It will have two major changes compared to the \"SEED\" app, including an all-new Liquid Glass design, and later an AI chatbot that can provide Apple Store and Apple Authorized Reseller employees with sales tips and product information.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen it arrives in a later update, the chatbot will be accessible from the \"Ask\" tab in the app, and employees will be able to ask it various Apple product knowledge questions. For example, they could ask about the iPhone Air's key features, or inquire about how the Instant Hotspot feature on the Mac works. We have not confirmed if the chatbot uses Apple's own large language model, or if it relies on a third-party platform.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"Sales Coach\" is also rolling out on the web at <a href=\"https://salescoach.apple.com/\">salescoach.apple.com</a>.

In other words, iOS 26 was available for around three weeks longer by comparison.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs was suspected, this means that iOS 26 adoption has officially been slower than iOS 18 adoption, but not to the extent that some earlier, unofficial estimates had claimed. There is no way of knowing exactly why iOS 26 adoption has been slower, but some users have opted to avoid the new Liquid Glass design for now.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\niPadOS 26 adoption figures are technically higher than iPadOS 18, but again, note that iPadOS 26 benefitted from three extra weeks of availability.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/apple-shares-ios-26-adoption-stats/\">Apple Reveals How Many iPhones Are Running iOS 26</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reveals-how-many-iphones-are-running-ios-26.2477659/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

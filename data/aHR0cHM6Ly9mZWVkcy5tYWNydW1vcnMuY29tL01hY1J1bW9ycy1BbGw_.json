It is equipped with a microphone and a button to start a recording, but little else.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/pebble-ring.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"839\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029572\" />\r<br/>\nPriced at &#36;75, the Index 01 does not require an internet connection or a subscription, and it doesn't record unless the button is pressed. Recordings are sent to a connected smartphone, and can be saved as a note, added to a calendar, or set as a reminder. Information is processed by open source speech-to-text and AI models locally on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or Android smartphone.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt is customizable, and single or double button clicks can be set to control different actions like switching to a new song, taking a photo, or activating smart home devices.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe device is made from stainless steel, and it is available in three colors, including silver, gold, and black. Sizes range from 6 to 13. It is resistant to water, and no charging is necessary. Pebble says the battery will last for 12 to 15 hours of recording, which equates to 10-20 recordings per day that are 3-6 seconds in length. Since there is no replaceable battery and no option to charge, the ring is meant to be recycled when the battery dies.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe title=\"We Made &#36;75 External Memory For Your Brain!\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ArxhS4SQaP0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r<br/>\nThe Pebble Index 01 is priced at &#36;75 and is <a href=\"https://repebble.com/index#buy\">available for pre-order from the Pebble website</a>.

      "content": "The simplified smartphone switching Apple and Google <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/08/iphone-android-switching-improvements/\">are adopting</a> is an example of how the Digital Markets Act (DMA) benefits users and developers, the European Commission said today. Apple and Google are making it easier for users to switch between <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and Android smartphones, adding an option to transfer data from another smartphone during the device setup process.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br/>\nApple and Google are implementing this functionality because the DMA requires services to offer effective data portability to avoid data lock-in to an operating system. The EC says the new interoperability is a \"direct result of the DMA.\"\r<br/>\n<blockquote>The European Commission welcomes the cross-OS data portability solution that has been communicated by Apple and Google. This is an example of how the Digital Markets Act (DMA) brings benefits to users and developers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis OS portability solution will allow users to easily transfer data from iPhone to Android and vice versa when they set up a new device. It will support many types of data, including: contacts, calendar events, messages, photos, documents, Wi-Fi networks, passwords, and even data from third-party apps. It will also work wirelessly. These are major upgrades compared to the currently limited data transfer solutions.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nThe DMA is also the reason why Apple and Google designed a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/ios-26-esim-android/\">simplified eSIM transfer solution</a> earlier this year. The EC says that both new features were made possible by \"extensive engineering work and collaboration\" between the two companies, along with \"intensive discussions with the Commission.\"\r<br/>\n<blockquote>Taken together, the eSIM transfer and the OS data portability solutions will greatly simplify the experience of users who want to switch from an iPhone to an Android phone, or vice versa. This improved data portability across platforms brings more user choice, which drives competition and creates more incentives to innovate. Users should be able to pick a new phone based on innovative features, not based on where their data is locked.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nApple and Google are currently testing the new smartphone switching solution. Google implemented it in an Android Canary build, and Apple is expected to add it in a future update to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>. Apple and Google will support transferring contacts, messages, photos, documents, Wi-Fi networks, passwords, information from third-party apps, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThough Apple and Google are implementing simplified switching due to DMA requirements, it is functionality that will be rolled out worldwide and not just in Europe.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe European Commission is highlighting DMA wins because earlier this year, Apple commissioned a study that said the Digital Markets Act has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/12/dma-no-lower-fees-study/\">failed to lower App Store prices</a> for consumers. Apple said the DMA has \"failed to live up to its promises,\" and has only delivered \"less security, less privacy, and a worse experience for consumers across Europe.\"<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/\">European Commission</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/09/eu-dma-apple-google-switching-tools/\">EU Takes Credit for Apple and Google&#039;s Upcoming iPhone-Android Data Transfer Tools</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-takes-credit-for-apple-and-googles-upcoming-iphone-android-data-transfer-tools.2474441/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Right now, the foldable market is dominated by Samsung and Google.\r<br/>\n<blockquote>\"The launch of Apple's first foldable iPhone will mark a turning point for the foldable segment,\" said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president of client devices at IDC. \"This move is likely to boost category awareness and drive consumer interest. Apple tends to be a catalyst for mainstream adoption of new categories. Although foldables will continue to be a niche segment from a volume perspective, it will become a relevant value driver for most vendors offering foldables, as average selling prices will be 3 times higher than a standard smartphone.\"</blockquote>\r<br/>\nThe overall foldable smartphone market is expected to grow 30 percent in 2026 thanks to Apple joining the market, with some growth also expected from Samsung's Galaxy Z Trifold launching in January 2026. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/idc-2026-foldables-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1430\" height=\"1192\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029561\" />\r<br/>\nRumors suggest Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">first foldable iPhone</a> will debut in fall 2026 alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/\">iPhone 18</a> Pro models. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold is expected to feature book-like design that folds horizontally, opening out into a larger <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> mini-sized display.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/idc-2026-foldables-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1430\" height=\"1192\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029562\" />\r<br/>\nThe device will be around 5.5 inches in size when folded, but it will open up to around 7.8 inches.

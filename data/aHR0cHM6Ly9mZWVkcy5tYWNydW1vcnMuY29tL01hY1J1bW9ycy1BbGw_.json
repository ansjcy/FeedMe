Telegram already has the feature, while Apple has offered a similar Send Later option in its Messages app since iOS 18.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile the feature is yet to be functioning in the latest WhatsApp beta on TestFlight, WABetaInfo shared an image showing a new Scheduled Messages option in a group chat info page. From here, users will apparently be able to view the number of messages they have scheduled and access options to manage them. The feature is expected to work for both individual chats and groups. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe ability to schedule messages is one of the app's most requested features, so this should come as welcome news to users. Currently, the only way to schedule a WhatsApp message is to use a shortcut workaround in Apple's Shortcuts app. <div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/24/whatsapp-scheduled-messages-coming/\">WhatsApp Working on Scheduled Messages Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-working-on-scheduled-messages-feature.2478144/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

In 2024, the Mac mini <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/\">received its first major redesign since 2010</a>, along with M4 and M4 Pro chips.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn the U.S., the Mac mini starts at just &#36;599, but customers must supply their own display, keyboard, and trackpad or mouse.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple began assembling its latest Mac Pro desktop computer in Texas <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/20/2019-mac-pro-production-begins/\">in 2019</a>, during U.S. President Donald Trump's first term, and the company's plan to begin assembling some Mac mini units in the U.S. comes during Trump's second term.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<em>The Wall Street Journal</em> also <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/inside-apples-push-to-build-an-all-american-chip-0cf39c16\">explored Apple's efforts to boost its U.S. chip production</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ktFlaBhpMu8?si=Ik1tBvr-IpLu4cqT\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r<br/>\nApple plans to purchase more than 100 million chips from TSMC's Arizona factory this year, according to the company's global head of procurement David Tom.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-wall-street-journal/\">The Wall Street Journal</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/23/mac-mini-us-manufacturing/\">Apple Announces Plans to Begin Assembling Mac Mini in U.S. This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-plans-to-begin-assembling-mac-mini-in-u-s-this-year.2478140/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "We've got just over a week to go until Apple's \"Special Experience\" on March 4, and we're expecting to see the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 17e announced during the week of the event. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will be the first update to the new low-cost <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a> that Apple unveiled in February 2025.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009543\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17e-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"design\">Design</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will look a lot like the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, featuring the same 6.1-inch display size, single-lens rear camera, and black and white color options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"display\">Display</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to feature the same display panel as the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, which means it will be limited to a 60Hz refresh rate. Apple brought 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates to the standard <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> in 2025, but the same technology is not expected for the more affordable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will continue to be Apple's only new release &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; without 120Hz support.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n120Hz refresh rates provide video improvements and smoother scrolling when viewing webpages.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; does not have always-on display technology, and that's not likely to change with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e. To support always-on, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e would need an OLED display with 1-nit minimum brightness, which is limited to Apple's more expensive iPhones. HDR and brightness are also lacking compared to Apple's flagship lineup.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic_island\">Dynamic Island</h3>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; uses the notch that Apple has eliminated in its newer flagship iPhones, but the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e could eliminate it. Some rumors suggest that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will have a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a> instead of a notch, giving it an updated look.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003664\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iPhone-14-Pro-Dynamic-Island.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; is a pill-shaped cutout on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display that houses the TrueDepth camera system and the front-facing camera. It takes up less display area than the notch, and it is better integrated into the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile some rumors indicate we could get a &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, other rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/iphone-17e-same-oled-panel-slimmer-bezels/\">continue to use a notch</a>, so the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; upgrade isn't a guarantee.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"a19_chip\">A19 Chip</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will use Apple's A19 chip, which is the same chip that's in the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;. The A19 chip is built on an upgraded N3P 3-nanometer process, offering a 5 to 10 percent performance improvement over the A18 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple could be planning to use a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/06/iphone-17e-dynamic-island-a19-chip/\">downclocked version</a> of the A19 chip in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e, and if that's the case, its performance won't quite match the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;'s performance.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A18 chip that Apple used in the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; had a 4-core GPU instead of a 5-core GPU like the version from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, so the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e could get a similar GPU downgrade.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAside from the improved CPU and GPU, the A19 has an updated display engine, image signal processor, and Neural Engine for improved AI performance. Every GPU core features a Neural Accelerator to boost the performance of local AI models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe are expecting the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e to continue to include 8GB RAM like the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;. Apple's other models have 12GB.\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"magsafe_compatibility\">MagSafe Compatibility</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; does not have a magnetic ring for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> charging, but the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to get a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; upgrade.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's iPhones have used &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; since the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12, so there are a wide array of &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; cases and accessories. The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is not compatible with these accessories, which is a major limitation.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSince it doesn't have &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is limited to 7.5W wireless charging speeds. &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; would upgrade that to at least 15W. The current &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models can charge at 25W over &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, though the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/\">iPhone Air</a> is limited to 20W.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"camera\">Camera</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to have a single 48-megapixel Wide Angle camera at the back, with no upgrade rumored. The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; doesn't have a Camera Control button, and there's no sign that Apple plans to bring it to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e, either.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models got an upgraded 18-megapixel Center Stage front-facing camera, but rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will continue to use the same 12-megapixel front-facing camera as the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"modem\">Modem</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will adopt Apple's C1X modem, the modem chip that Apple first debuted in the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;. The C1X modem is faster and more efficient than the C1 modem that Apple used in the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple says the C1X modem is up to 2x faster than the C1, and it is far more energy efficient than Qualcomm modems.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"no_n1_chip\">N1 Chip</h2>\r<br/>\nApple could update the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models with Apple's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth \"N1\" networking chip, bringing speed and efficiency improvements, plus Thread support. Leaked Apple code suggests the chip will not be included in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e in order to keep costs down, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/iphone-17e-launch-imminent-with-four-features/\">recent rumors indicate</a> Apple plans to include it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;599, and no price changes are expected for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"launch_date\">Launch Date</h2>\r<br/>\nApple is holding a \"Special Experience\" event on March 4, and we are expecting the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e to launch during that same week.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/23/iphone-17e-latest-rumors/\">What to Expect From the iPhone 17e Launching in March 2026</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-the-iphone-17e-launching-in-march-2026.2478135/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

In this beta, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users can send encrypted messages to Android users.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users will need to install the second beta of iOS 26.4 to exchange encrypted messages with Android users, while Google users need to have the latest version of Google Messages.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAccording to Apple's developer release notes for beta 2, while E2EE is being tested for &zwnj;RCS&zwnj;, it isn't going to ship in iOS 26.4 and will instead come at a later date.\r<br/>\n<blockquote>In this beta, RCS end-to-end encryption will become available for testing between Apple and Android devices. This feature is not shipping in this release and will be available to customers in future iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS 26 releases. End-to-end encryption is in beta and is not available for all devices or carriers. Conversations labeled as encrypted are encrypted end-to-end, so messages can't be read while they're sent between devices.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nApple worked with the GSM Association to implement end-to-end encryption. iMessage, which is used for texts between iPhones, has long supported end-to-end encryption. Android's &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; implementation already has E2EE for Android-to-Android texts, but there is no full encryption for iPhone-to-Android and Android-to-iPhone conversations at the current time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nE2EE is not available for all devices or all carriers during the beta testing period.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/\">RCS</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/23/ios-26-4-beta-2-android-iphone-e2ee/\">iOS 26.4 Beta Adds End-to-End Encryption for iPhone-to-Android RCS Texts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-4-beta-adds-end-to-end-encryption-for-iphone-to-android-rcs-texts.2478121/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

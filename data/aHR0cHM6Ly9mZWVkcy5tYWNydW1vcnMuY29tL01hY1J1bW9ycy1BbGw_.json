      "content": "Apple is working on a 12th-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and plans to update the most affordable tablet in the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup next spring. It's not going to be a major update, but if you're planning a purchase, you might want to wait for the newest model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1008458\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/11th-gen-ipad-blue.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"design\">Design</h2>\r<br/>\nThere are no rumors of an updated design for the 12th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, so it will likely have the same 11-inch edge-to-edge display with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> Side Button and thick bezels.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple last updated the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s design with the 10th-generation model, giving the device a more modern look to better match the designs of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is only available in a single screen size, and it is Apple's thickest tablet at 7mm. It features a Retina LED display with no ProMotion support, no P3 wide color, and no lamination (display technology that allows for improved visuals) compared to Apple's other tablets.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple makes the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in several fun colors, and we could see some new shades in 2026. Current colors include blue, pink, silver, and yellow.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNo changes are expected for the rear camera, front camera, USB-C port, or compatibility with accessories like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"a-series_processor\">A-Series Processor</h2>\r<br/>\nRumors suggest the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will use Apple's A18 chip, which is the chip that Apple used for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus. It is built on a 3-nanometer process and it will offer speed and efficiency improvements over the A16 chip that's in the current model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A16 chip that Apple used in 2025 does not support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, but the A18 does, so that will mark a major update for Apple's affordable tablet. The 2026 model should be able to support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features that are unavailable with the 2025 model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A18 also offers hardware-accelerated ray tracing and similar features for improved gameplay.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; has 6GB RAM, but Apple will need to bump that up to 8GB for &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"n1_chip\">N1 Chip</h2>\r<br/>\nApple debuted its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip, called the N1, in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> models. The N1 was added to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and it's likely that Apple plans to add the chip to all future devices coming in 2026 and beyond.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe N1 chip supports Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread networking technology for smart home devices.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is limited to Wi-Fi 6, so if the 12th-generation version does indeed get Wi-Fi 7, it will be able to connect to faster 6GHz networks for the first time. Bluetooth 6 would also be an improvement over Bluetooth 5.3.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"apple_modem\">Apple Modem</h2>\r<br/>\nApple has designed C1 and C1X modem chips that it has used in iPhones and iPads in 2025, and the next-generation version of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; could also get an Apple-designed modem chip for cellular models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's modem chips are more power efficient than Qualcomm chips while providing similar performance.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h2>\r<br/>\nThe 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;349 for 128GB of storage, and there are so far no indications that pricing is going to change for the 12th-generation model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"launch_date\">Launch Date</h2>\r<br/>\nApple plans to release the new low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in spring 2026, which is a timeframe that spans from March 20 to June 20. The launch will likely come sometime in March or April, with Apple also set to update the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Neutral)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-12/\">12th-Generation iPad: Release Date, Specs, and Everything We Know About Apple&#039;s 2026 Budget Tablet</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/12th-generation-ipad-release-date-specs-and-everything-we-know-about-apples-2026-budget-tablet.2471538/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Digital IDs in the Wallet app can only be used for domestic travel.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Age Verification</h2>\r<br/>\nState IDs stored in the Wallet app can be used for age verification purposes at businesses and retailers that support the functionality. Apple is also adding support for using IDs for age verification in apps and on websites.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Physical ID Requirements</h2>\r<br/>\nMost states say that &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users are still required to present a physical ID if requested, and a digital ID cannot be used in lieu of an actual ID.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDigital IDs based on a passport cannot be used for international travel or border crossing purposes, so a physical passport is still required.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>How to Add an ID</h2>\r<br/>\nAn eligible driver's license, ID, or passport can be added to the Wallet app on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; by tapping on the \"+\" sign in the upper right corner and then choosing the \"Driver's License and ID Cards\" option.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Device Compatibility</h2>\r<br/>\nUsing the digital ID feature in the Wallet app requires an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8 or later with iOS 16.5 or later or an Apple Watch Series 4 or later running watchOS 9.5 or later.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAdding a passport requires an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 or later running iOS 26.1 or later or an Apple Watch Series 6 running watchOS 26.1 or later.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/19/wallet-app-drivers-licenses-all-states/\">Here Are All the States That Support Digital Driver&#039;s Licenses in the iPhone Wallet App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-all-the-states-that-support-digital-drivers-licenses-in-the-iphone-wallet-app.2471537/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The section provides tips on what to expect, pulling information from user reviews and other online content. It can include tips on how to book a reservation, what the secret menu items are, where to park, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAn updated Explore tab features trending and popular restaurants, activities, and popular sites near you. The suggestions can be accessed by swiping up, with curated lists from trusted sites easier to access.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nElectric vehicle owners already have access to real-time information on whether charging locations have an open spot, but Google Maps will now use AI to predict how many chargers will likely be available at your arrival time to a charging location. Google says the feature uses AI to analyze historical and real-time charger availability for predictions so you can avoid charging lines.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFinally, Google is now adding support for sharing reviews without using your real name. Users can choose a nickname and profile picture to be associated with their reviews.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nInsider tips are available today for iOS users, while the updated Explore tab and the review name change option is rolling out this month.

The EC says that users will be able to indicate their cookie consent with a single click, with those preferences saved through the central settings of preferences in browsers and operating systems.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt sounds like browser makers will need to have a GDPR toggle that informs websites of a user's preference, eliminating the need for users to consent to cookies on a site-by-site basis.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn addition to changing GDPR cookie requirements, the EC's proposal allows personal data to be used to train AI without express consent, simplifies cybersecurity reporting, improves access to data through simplified rules, and more, with full details available in the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2718\">European Commission's press release</a>. It also delays the implementation of parts of the Artificial Intelligence Act, giving companies a longer period to comply with the rules.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCritics of the changes suggest that the EC is watering down the GDPR and rolling back consumer protections. <a href=\"https://edri.org/our-work/commissions-digital-omnibus-is-a-major-rollback-of-eu-digital-protections/\">European Digital Rights</a> (EDRi) said that the EC's changes risk \"dismantling the very foundation of human rights and tech policy in the EU.\"<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/\">European Commission</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/gdpr/\">GDPR</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/19/europe-gdpr-cookie-changes/\">Europe Wants to Cut Down on Annoying GDPR Cookie Pop-Ups</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/europe-wants-to-cut-down-on-annoying-gdpr-cookie-pop-ups.2471531/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

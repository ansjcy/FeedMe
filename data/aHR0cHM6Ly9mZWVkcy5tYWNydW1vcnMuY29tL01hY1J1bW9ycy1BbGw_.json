There have been a range of price estimates, from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/16/foldable-iphone-thickness-and-price-rumors/\">as low as &#36;1,800</a> to as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\">high as &#36;2,500</a>, and the latest estimate falls on the higher side.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Iridescent-Search.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-995557\" />\r<br/>\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> previously said he expects the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold to cost between &#36;2,000 and &#36;2,500, and <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> expects it to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/\">somewhere around &#36;2,000</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will be expensive because of the premium components that Apple plans to use. The display panel and hinge will push pricing toward the upper end of market expectations, Fubon Research suggests.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDemand for the device will depend on the price that Apple sets, but Fubon believes that Apple could sell around 5.4 million units in 2026. Global smartphone demand could fall during the year, and foldables will be the \"only spotlight\" in the 2026 smartphone market.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe report says that Apple is also working on camera upgrades for 2026, with the first variable aperture lens planned for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/\">iPhone 18</a> Pro models. It doesn't sound like the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold will get the variable aperture lens that Apple is developing, but rumors indicate it will have a dual-lens rear camera setup with Wide and Ultra Wide lenses along with two front cameras.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/\">iPhone 18</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/24/foldable-iphone-could-cost-2400/\">Foldable iPhone Could Cost &#36;2,400</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-could-cost-2-400.2471840/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The Opus 4.5 model offers better vision, reasoning, mathematics skills, and coding than prior versions of Claude.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlong with the Opus update, Anthropic is updating its apps, the Claude Developer Platform, and Claude Code. There are tools for longer-running agents, and options to use Claude in Excel, Chrome, and on the desktop.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn the Claude apps, users will no longer run into limits during a long conversation. Claude is able to automatically summarize earlier context, which means the conversation can keep going endlessly. Claude for Chrome is available to all Max users, and Claude for Excel beta access is now available to all Max, Team, and Enterprise users.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nClaude Code is now available in the desktop app, and with Opus 4.5, it is able to build more precise plans and execute them more thoroughly. Claude is able to ask clarifying questions upfront and then build a user-editable plan before executing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nClaude Opus 4.5 is available today across Anthropic's apps and its API. Opus-specific caps have been removed for Claude and Claude Code users with access to Opus 4.5, and for Max and Team Premium members, overall usage limits have increased.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/24/anthropic-claude-opus-4-5/\">Anthropic Launches Claude Opus 4.5 With Improved Coding and Agent Capabilities</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/anthropic-launches-claude-opus-4-5-with-improved-coding-and-agent-capabilities.2471839/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

There's now an established hardware prototype, and while Altman and Ive didn't explain what it is in plain language, the interview has hints of its design and functionality.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHere are several ways that Altman and Ive described their AI hardware device:\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li>It breaks the constraints of the \"same kind of computer that we've been using for a long time.\"</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Research started with a question about what it means that the device \"is going to be able to know everything you've ever thought about, read, said?\"</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>It will be a \"sort of active participant\" that's proactive in \"a not annoying way.\"</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Current devices and apps are like \"walking through Times Square in New York\" with flashing lights, crowds of people, noises, etc. It \"doesn't make our lives peaceful and calm\" or let us \"focus on other stuff,\" which is what Ive and Altman wanted to address.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>If you have an AI that you trust to do things for you and filter things out with \"incredible contextual awareness of your whole life,\" then you can go for a vibe that's not walking through Times Square.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Ive and Altman's device aims to bring some of the spirit of \"sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and just sort of enjoying the peace and calm.\"</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Ive said he prefers solutions that \"teeter on appearing almost naive in their simplicity and their feel.\"</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>He also likes \"incredibly intelligent, sophisticated products that you want to touch\" and use \"almost carelessly.\"</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Ive told Altman that the design is right when you \"want to lick it or take a bite out of it,\" and with the current prototype, Altman got that feeling.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>\"The degree to which Jony chipped away at every little thing that this doesn't need to do or that doesn't need to be there is remarkable.\"</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>\"There's something about when a design gets like so simple and beautiful. And playful, for lack of a better word.\" There aren't a lot of products with \"humor\" in \"this area\" and there is a desire \"not to take ourselves quite so seriously even though these are serious times.\"</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Altman said that early on, Jony said \"we are going to make people smile. We're going to make people feel joy. Whatever the product does, it has to do that.\" Altman said it's \"lovely\" to \"have some whimsy back.\"</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>The prototypes are \"jaw-droppingly good\" and \"exciting.\"</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nRumors have described the device that io is working on as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/jony-ive-ai-phone-without-a-screen/\">an AI phone</a> without a screen, a \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/jony-ive-openai-product-third-core-device/\">third core device</a>\" after a MacBook and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> that's unobtrusive and able to sit in a pocket or on a desk, an iPod Shuffle-sized device that's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/ming-chi-kuo-on-openai-device-design/\">neck worn</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/details-leak-jony-ive-openai-device/\">pocket-sized gadget</a> that's screen-free but contextually aware of your life with microphones and cameras.

      "content": "Apple is making cuts and has laid off dozens of people in sales roles, reports <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-24/apple-aapl-cuts-jobs-across-its-sales-organization-in-rare-layoff\">Bloomberg</a></em>. Apple is aiming to simplify the way that it sells products to businesses, schools, and governments.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/Apple-Park-View.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1440\" height=\"790\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-854420\" />\r<br/>\nAffected employees received notice over the past couple of weeks, and positions eliminated include account managers for large businesses, schools, and government agencies, plus staff at Apple's briefing centers for major customers. Employees were reportedly surprised by the layoffs, but they are able to apply for other positions within Apple.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple told <em>Bloomberg</em> that it is making changes in its sales team to better connect with customers.\r<br/>\n<blockquote>To connect with even more customers, we are making some changes in our sales team that affect a small number of roles. We are continuing to hire and those employees can apply for new roles.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nWhile Apple says it is restructuring some of the sales team, affected employees apparently believe that Apple wants to move more sales to third-party retailers. Pushing sales through retailers allows Apple to save money by cutting salary costs.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is giving employees over a month to find a new role. Those who haven't gotten another position in the company by January 20 will receive a severance package.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/24/apple-eliminates-sales-roles/\">Rare Layoffs at Apple Impact Dozens in Sales Roles</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rare-layoffs-at-apple-impact-dozens-in-sales-roles.2471833/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

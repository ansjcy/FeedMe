In iOS 26.3, EU wearable device makers can now test proximity pairing and improved notifications.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHere are the new capabilities that Apple is adding:\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Proximity pairing</strong> - Devices like earbuds will be able to pair with an iOS device in an AirPods-like way by bringing the accessory close to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> to initiate a simple, one-tap pairing process. Pairing third-party devices will no longer require multiple steps.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Notifications</strong> - Third-party accessories like smart watches will be able to receive notifications from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Users will be able to view and react to incoming notifications, which is functionality normally limited to the Apple Watch. Notifications can only be forwarded to one connected device at a time, and turning on notifications for a third-party device disables notifications to an Apple Watch.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nThe European Commission says that developers can test third-party TVs, smart watches, and headphones with the new features in iOS 26.3, with the functionality to be \"fully available in Europe\" in 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\niOS 26.3 offers \"another step towards a more inter-connected digital ecosystem to the benefit of all EU citizens,\" according to the European Commission. iOS 26.3 is expected to launch at the end of January.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe changes to proximity pairing and notifications are only available for device makers and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; users in the European Union.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/22/ios-26-3-dma-airpods-pairing/\">iOS 26.3 Brings AirPods-Like Pairing to Third-Party Devices in EU Under DMA</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-3-brings-airpods-like-pairing-to-third-party-devices-in-eu-under-dma.2475090/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

There were rumors suggesting Apple would release the new &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; before the end of 2025, but it looks like that's not going to happen now.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe title=\"No New Apple TV in 2025? Here's What Apple Might Be Waiting For\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xKE874Bz6xg\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> said several times <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-tv-homepod-mini-2025-launch/\">across 2024</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timing/\">2025</a> that Apple would update both the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> and the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K toward the end of the year, and we also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/new-apple-tv-still-launching-this-year/\">heard the same information</a> from other sources. No announcement happened in September alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> launch, and when Apple updated the Vision Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> in October, there was no sign of the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt's not clear what happened, but it's possible Apple decided to hold all home-related product announcements until spring 2026, when the smarter, more capable version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> will be ready in iOS 26.4.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThat's right around the time when Apple is rumored to be launching its new home hub device, so we could see the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, home hub, and &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; sometime in late March or April.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Rumored Features</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; isn't going to get a major design overhaul, but there are some useful updates in store. It's long overdue for a new chip, and Apple's newer chip options will bring gaming improvements.\r<br/>\n<h3>A-Series Chip</h3>\r<br/>\nThe next-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; is expected to get an updated A-series chip, and Apple backend code we found suggests that it'll use the A17 Pro. The A17 Pro is the chip that Apple first used in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 15 Pro models, and it would bring <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> support to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; for the first time. The A17 Pro is built on 3-nanometer technology and it would also bring support for console-quality games thanks to much improved CPU and GPU performance. It'll be a significant improvement over the current A15 Bionic chip.\r<br/>\n<h3>N1 Chip</h3>\r<br/>\nApple debuted its custom N1 networking chip in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> models, and rumors suggest that the N1 will also be used in the upcoming &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;. It adds support for Wi-Fi 7, which is not a current &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; feature. With Wi-Fi 7 support, the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; will be able to connect to Wi-Fi networks that support the faster and less crowded 6GHz band. Users can expect faster Wi-Fi speeds and lower latency.\r<br/>\n<h3>New Siri Features</h3>\r<br/>\nWith a faster chip that supports &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, the next-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; will support the LLM version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; coming in 2026. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be more like Claude or ChatGPT, which could lead to better &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; recommendations, the option to use voice commands to do more than before, better support for questions about actors and music in movies and shows, and much more.\r<br/>\n<h3>Pricing</h3>\r<br/>\nThere's a possibility that Apple will cut costs for the next &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, and Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has suggested that Apple is targeting a price point around &#36;100. With the A17 Pro chip and the N1 chip, Apple might not be able to hit that price with the flagship model, but there could be a lower-end entry-level option that's more affordable. Pricing right now starts at &#36;129.\r<br/>\n<h2>New Launch Date</h2>\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/02/new-apple-tv-and-homepod-mini-launching-soon/\">In early November</a>, Gurman said that an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; and &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; \"shouldn't be too far off\" based on dwindling supplies of the devices at Apple retail stores. At the time, he said a post-2025 debut was a possibility, but he confirmed the products are ready to go and could launch at any time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; and &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; will \"help showcase the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; and &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features\" that Apple has coming, which makes the spring timing sound even more likely.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/22/where-is-the-new-apple-tv/\">Where&#039;s the New Apple TV?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wheres-the-new-apple-tv.2475085/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Italy's Competition Authority (AGCM) has imposed a €98.6 million (&#36;116 million) fine on Apple over its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-tracking-transparency/\">App Tracking Transparency</a> feature.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/generic-tracking-prompt-orange.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1956\" height=\"1100\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1030804\" />\r<br/>\nSince the release of iOS 14.5 in April 2021, Apple has required apps to ask for permission before tracking a user's activity across other apps and websites for personalized advertising, as part of a feature named App Tracking Transparency. If a user selects the \"Ask App Not to Track\" option, the app is unable to access the device's advertising identifier.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn a <a href=\"https://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2025/12/A561\">press release</a> and <a href=\"https://en.agcm.it/dotcmsdoc/pressrelease/A561_SUMMARY.pdf\">executive summary</a> today, the AGCM said the App Tracking Transparency rules are \"disproportionate,\" and \"harmful\" to app developers and advertisers. Ultimately, it found that Apple abused its dominant position in the EU market.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe regulator does not take issue with Apple implementing policies that are designed to strengthen privacy and security for users, but it said the App Tracking Transparency feature is \"excessively burdensome for developers.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSpecifically, iPhone and iPad users in the EU are presented with both App Tracking Transparency and GDPR-related permission prompts in apps, and the AGCM found this \"double consent\" requirement to be harmful to app developers and advertisers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"Apple could have achieved the same level of privacy protection for its users through means less restrictive of competition,\" the AGCM said. \"This would have prevented the unilateral imposition of additional burdens on third-party developers, thereby avoiding the above-mentioned double consent requests for advertising purposes.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe regulator also found that the App Tracking Transparency rules appear capable of generating financial benefits for Apple, even though the feature applies to its own apps as well. The only reason that Apple apps do not show an App Tracking Transparency prompt is because Apple does not track user activity across other apps and websites.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn a statement shared with several media outlets, Apple said it will appeal the decision, and it touted the privacy benefits of App Tracking Transparency.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEarlier this year, Apple warned that it may be forced to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/23/apple-app-tracking-transparency-europe/\">stop offering App Tracking Transparency in the EU</a> due to regulatory pressures in countries such as Italy, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/apple-hit-with-162-million-fine-over-att/\">France</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/02/germany-app-tracking-transparency/\">Germany</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/25/apple-polish-probe-app-tracking-transparency/\">Poland</a>, and from the overarching European Commission.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-tracking-transparency/\">App Tracking Transparency</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/22/italy-fines-apple-over-app-tracking-transparency/\">Apple Hit With Supersized Fine in Italy Over an iPhone Privacy Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-hit-with-supersized-fine-in-italy-over-an-iphone-privacy-feature.2475075/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The shift is expected to result in Samsung supplying roughly 60% to 70% of the low-power DRAM used in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>, compared with a more even split with SK Hynix in previous generations, with Micron also participating as a smaller supplier.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe change is occurring against a backdrop of tightening supply in the global memory market. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; relies on low-power double data rate memory (LPDDR), which is optimized for energy efficiency and thermal performance in mobile devices. While Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron all manufacture LPDDR at scale, industry sources report that SK Hynix and Micron have increasingly redirected production capacity toward high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which is in high demand for artificial intelligence accelerators and data center hardware. As a result, their available capacity for mobile-focused LPDDR has become heavily constrained.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBy contrast, Samsung has apparently maintained substantial production of general-purpose and mobile DRAM, allowing it to meet Apple's requirement for extremely large and predictable volumes. Samsung is said to be the only company that can meet Apple's conditions in a situation where SK Hynix seems to be focused on HBM.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAccording to the report, Apple's hardware is particularly sensitive to momentary voltage spikes, which are not well accommodated by its latest chips, including the A19 and A19 Pro. This places additional pressure on memory suppliers to deliver components that perform identically across very large production runs. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe price of a 12GB LPDDR5X module, the likes of which are used in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/\">iPhone Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, has risen sharply from around &#36;30 at the beginning of 2025 to roughly &#36;70 today. Apple's scale and long-standing practice of negotiating multi-year supply agreements typically provide some insulation from short-term price volatility, but the magnitude of the increase has made supplier reliability and volume commitments more important. Concentrating a much larger share of orders with Samsung should allow Apple to secure more predictable deliveries and potentially benefit from economies of scale, even as overall component costs rise.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/22/apple-clings-to-samsung-as-ram-prices-soar/\">Apple Clings to Samsung as RAM Prices Soar</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-clings-to-samsung-as-ram-prices-soar.2475072/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

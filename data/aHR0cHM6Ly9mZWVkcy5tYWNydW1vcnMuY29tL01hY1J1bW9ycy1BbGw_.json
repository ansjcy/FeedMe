      "content": "Samsung <a href=\"https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/press-releases/introducing-galaxy-z-trifold-the-shape-of-whats-next-in-mobile-innovation\">today introduced</a> the Galaxy Z TriFold, its first smartphone that has three total screens and two folds instead of one. The Galaxy Z TriFold features a 10-inch display when opened, and a 6.5-inch cover screen when closed, with \"minimized creasing.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/samsung-galaxy-trifold-back.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028817\" />\r<br/>\nThe device has an inward-folding design that's meant to protect the main display, and Samsung says that the \"easy opening and closing\" folding mechanism has been engineered with an alarm that alerts the user if it's folded incorrectly. Samsung is using a titanium Armor FlexHinge with two differently sized hinges that work together with a dual-rail structure. Samsung claims that the new design offers a smoother, more stable fold despite the varying weight across each display, plus greater durability thanks to the inclusion of a \"thin piece of metal\" that protects the folding mechanism. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/samsung-galaxy-trifold.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1440\" height=\"923\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028815\" />\r<br/>\nA third of the display is 3.9mm thick when the smartphone is unfolded, though it is thicker in the area with the triple-lens camera. The main center screen is a bit thicker at 4.2mm, and the screen with the side button is 4mm. There is a reinforced overcoat over a shock absorbing display layer for better resistance, and the aluminum frame keeps the screens from making contact with one another. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/samsung-galaxy-trifold-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1620\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028816\" />\r<br/>\nThere's a 5,600 mAh three-cell battery system with one battery behind each display panel. Samsung says it is the largest battery that it has used in a smartphone to date. There are three cameras at the rear of the device, including a 200-megapixel wide angle camera, a 12-megapixel ultra wide camera, and a 10-megapixel telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. There are two 10-megapixel selfie cameras on the cover screen and the main screen. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/samsung-galaxy-trifold-thickness.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1267\" height=\"713\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028818\" />\r<br/>\nGalaxy Z TriFold users can use three different portrait-sized apps side-by-side, resize apps in a multi-window view, watch shows in full screen, or hold the device vertically for reading. Samsung added standalone Samsung DeX, so the Galaxy Z TriFold supports up to four workspaces with five apps running simultaneously. Samsung apps have been optimized for the larger screen, as has Google's Gemini Live. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Galaxy Z TriFold is launching in Korea on December 12, and it will expand to other markets like China, Taiwan, Singapore, and the UAE later. It will launch in the United States in the first quarter of 2026, and pricing is unknown. \r<br/>\n<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-debut/\">Samsung Launches Galaxy Z TriFold Smartphone With 10-Inch Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-launches-galaxy-z-trifold-smartphone-with-10-inch-display.2473605/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "We're getting closer to the launch of the final major iOS update of the year, with Apple set to release iOS 26.2 in December. We've had three betas so far and are expecting a fourth beta or a release candidate this week, so a launch could follow as soon as next week.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/iOS-26.2-Whats-New-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027938\" />\r<br/>\n<h2>Past Launch Dates</h2>\r<br/>\nApple's past iOS x.2 updates from the last few years have all happened right around the middle of the month, which gives us some insight into when iOS 26.2 will launch.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>iOS 18.2</strong> - RC on Thursday, December 5, launch on Wednesday, December 11. Four betas total before RC, with beta 4 on Wednesday, November 20.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>iOS 17.2</strong> - RC on Tuesday, December 5, launch on Monday, December 11. Four betas total before RC, with beta 4 on Tuesday, November 28.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>iOS 16.2</strong> - RC on Wednesday, December 7, launch on Tuesday, December 13. Four betas total before RC, with beta 4 on Thursday, December 1.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>iOS 15.2</strong> - RC on Tuesday, December 7, launch on Monday, December 13. Four betas total before RC, with beta 4 on Thursday, December 2.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>iOS 14.2</strong> - RC on Friday, October 30, launch on Thursday, November 5. Four betas total before RC, with beta 4 on Tuesday, October 20.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nApple has stuck to a December launch schedule for x.2 updates since 2021. Before that, updates were less scheduled with more variation in launch timeline. RCs have consistently come during the first week of December, with a launch during the second week.\r<br/>\n<h2>Possible Scenarios</h2>\r<br/>\nCompared to the past two years, Apple is a bit behind on the launch of the fourth beta. With iOS 17.2 and iOS 18.2, the last beta came in November, so the RC was able to launch earlier in the month.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis year, we haven't had a fourth beta yet. We should be getting it sometime this week between Tuesday and Thursday. Apple has historically waited a week between beta 4 and the RC, and then another week before releasing the update. If Apple sticks to a similar timeline this year, we'll see the following:\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Beta 4 between December 2-4, RC between December 8-11, iOS 26.2 launch on December 15 or December 16.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nDecember 15 or 16 would mark the latest that we've had an x.2 release since Apple adopted a more consistent update schedule. It's possible Apple might want to speed things up. If that's the case, we could see this launch timeline:\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Beta 4 between December 2-4, RC between December 4 and 8, launch around December 11.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nApple could condense the amount of time between the fourth beta and the RC, or the amount of time between the RC and launch. There's also a possibility that we don't get a fourth beta at all. With no fourth beta, the timeline looks like this:\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li>RC between December 2-4, launch between December 8-11.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nApple has consistently done four betas before an RC, and there are some major regulatory updates in Japan, so the first scenario with the later iOS 26.2 launch date seems the most likely at this point.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEither way, iOS 26.2 is coming in just a couple of weeks.\r<br/>\n<h2>iOS 26.2 Features</h2>\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 isn't a major update for most people outside of Japan, but there are a handful of useful new features.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Reminder Alarms</strong> - You can elect to have an alarm go off when a reminder is due, with standard stop and snooze options.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Lock Screen</strong> - There's a slider that lets you adjust the Liquid Glass transparency of the clock.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>AirDrop</strong> - iOS 26.2 lets you generate a one-time AirDrop code for file sharing with someone who isn't in your contacts list. It supports file exchanges for a 30-day period.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Sleep Score</strong> - Sleep Score ranges have been adjusted to better reflect how people might be feeling after a night's sleep.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Live Translation</strong> - AirPods Live Translation is expanding to the EU.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Japan</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users in Japan will be able to download apps from alternative app stores and replace <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> with a different personal assistant.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nThere are even more features in iOS 26.2, with a full list <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-2-beta-everything-new/\">available in our features guide</a>.\r<br/>\n<h2>iOS 26.3</h2>\r<br/>\nApple often follows launches with new betas, so while iOS 26.2 will be the last major software update of the year, we're still likely to get a glimpse of what's in iOS 26.3 before 2026 rolls around.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe first beta of iOS 18.3 came out on December 16, the first beta of iOS 17.3 came on December 12, and the first beta of iOS 16.3 came out on December 14. The first beta of iOS 26.3 should come the day after iOS 26.2. Unfortunately, the x.3 updates are often more focused on internal improvements than outward-facing features, so we are finished with exciting updates until 2026.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/ios-26-2-release-date/\">When Will Apple Release iOS 26.2?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/when-will-apple-release-ios-26-2.2473604/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Though ad mentions were found in the Android app, it's likely a change that's coming to ChatGPT on all platforms, including iOS, Mac, and the desktop.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ChatGPT Android app 1.2025.329 beta includes new references to an &quot;ads feature&quot; with &quot;bazaar content&quot;, &quot;search ad&quot; and &quot;search ads carousel&quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/BdHOJIQHmA\">pic.twitter.com/BdHOJIQHmA</a></p>&mdash; Tibor Blaho (@btibor91) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btibor91/status/1994714152636690834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r<br/>\nGiven the \"search\" wording, it's possible ads will be limited to web searches and shopping research requests.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAccess to ChatGPT starts at &#36;20 per month for the Plus plan, with a ChatGPT Pro plan available for &#36;200 per month with higher access limits. There are also business and education plans, along with the current free plan. In other countries, OpenAI offers a cheaper \"Go\" plan that could also expand to the United States when ads roll out.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/27/openai-might-raise-the-price-of-chatgpt-to-22-by-2025-44-by-2029/\">have been rumors</a> that OpenAI plans to gradually raise the price of ChatGPT access, and a plan restructuring with an ad-supported tier seems like the ideal time to make pricing changes.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs noted by <em><a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/chatgpt-ads-android-code-user-reports-first-ad-465517\">Search Engine Land</a></em>, OpenAI executives have been changing their messaging around ads over the course of the last 12 months. In late 2024, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said ads were a \"last resort,\" but in early 2025, leaked internal forecasts included &#36;1 billion in \"free user monetization\" revenue in 2026. <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/sam-altman-chatgpt-ads-pivot-463150\">Earlier this year</a>, Altman said that he loved Instagram ads and felt they were valuable.

      "content": "Apple AI chief John Giannandrea is stepping down from his position and retiring in spring 2026, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/john-giannandrea-to-retire-from-apple/\">Apple announced today</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-994723\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Sad-Siri-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br/>\nGiannandrea will serve as an advisor between now and 2026, with former Microsoft AI researcher Amar Subramanya set to take over as vice president of AI. Subramanya will report to Apple engineering chief Craig Federighi, and will lead Apple Foundation Models, ML research, and AI Safety and Evaluation.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSubramanya was previously corporate vice president of AI at Microsoft, and before that, he spent 16 years at Google. He was head of engineering for Google's Gemini Assistant, and Apple says that he has \"deep expertise\" in both AI and ML research that will be important to \"Apple's ongoing innovation and future <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> features.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSome of the teams that Giannandrea oversaw will move to Sabih Khan and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/\">Eddy Cue</a>, such as AI Infrastructure and Search and Knowledge. Khan is Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/08/jeff-williams-stepping-down-as-apple-coo/\">new Chief Operating Officer</a> who took over for Jeff Williams earlier this year. Cue has long overseen Apple services.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> thanked Giannandrea for his role advancing Apple's AI work, and he said that he looks forward to working with Subramanya. He also said that Federighi has played an important role in Apple's AI efforts.\r<br/>\n<blockquote>\"We are thankful for the role John played in building and advancing our AI work, helping Apple continue to innovate and enrich the lives of our users,\" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. \"AI has long been central to Apple's strategy, and we are pleased to welcome Amar to Craig's leadership team and to bring his extraordinary AI expertise to Apple. In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar's joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year.\"</blockquote>\r<br/>\nApple said that it is \"poised to accelerate its work in delivering intelligent, trusted, and profoundly personal experiences\" with the new AI team.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGiannandrea's departure comes after Apple's major iOS 18 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> failure. Apple introduced a smarter, \"&zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;\" version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; at WWDC 2024, and advertised the functionality when marketing the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>. In early 2025, Apple announced that it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/\">would not be able to release</a> the promised version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; as planned, and updates were delayed until spring 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/07/apple-ai-executive-leaves-for-meta/\">An exodus of Apple's AI team</a> followed as Apple scrambled to improve &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; and deliver on features like personal context, onscreen awareness, and improved app integration. Apple is now rumored to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/05/apple-siri-google-gemini-partnership/\">partnering with Google</a> for a more advanced version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; and other &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features that are set to come out next year.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/apple-ai-chief-retiring-after-siri-failure/\">Apple AI Chief John Giannandrea Retiring After Siri Delays</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ai-chief-john-giannandrea-retiring-after-siri-delays.2473595/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

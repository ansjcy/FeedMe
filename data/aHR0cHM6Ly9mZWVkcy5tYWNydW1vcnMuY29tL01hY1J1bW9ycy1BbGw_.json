      "content": "Apple is planning to hold an \"Experience\" on March 4 for select members of the media, and in the days before the event, we're expecting several product refreshes. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> is one of the new devices that could get an update, so we thought we'd highlight what's coming.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996976\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/m3-ipad-air-blue-hue.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"design_and_display\">Design and Display</h2>\r<br/>\nThere are no design changes rumored for the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, so we can expect the same 11-inch and 13-inch size options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is thicker and heavier than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, and it uses a standard LED display instead of OLED technology. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will eventually be upgraded to OLED, but for now, the higher-end display technology will remain limited to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; also doesn't support ProMotion, and there's no sign that Apple is planning to add it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will continue to feature USB-C, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> top button, and the same front and rear cameras.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt's possible there will be a new color option, but it's not guaranteed with a minor refresh. No new accessories are rumored, and it will continue to work with the Magic Keyboard and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> Pro.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"m4_chip\">M4 Chip</h2>\r<br/>\nApple has been updating the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; with an M-series chip that's a generation behind the chip in the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. Since the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; was updated in October 2025 with the M5, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is set to get the M4 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe M3 in the current &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and the M4 chip are both built on a 3-nanometer process, but the M4 has an updated process that brings speed and efficiency improvements.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are up to 10 CPU cores instead of 8, the Neural Engine is faster, and there's more memory bandwidth. The GPU is also more power efficient for potential battery gains. The M4 CPU is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3-vs-m4/\">up to 30 percent faster</a> than the M3 CPU, while the GPU is up to 21 percent faster.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; already supports <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, and the next-generation model will continue to do so. Apple increased the RAM in &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models with higher storage tiers, but there's no word on whether that same change will come to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. Current models feature 8GB RAM, the minimum for &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"charging\">Charging</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; gained faster charging with the M5 update, and that's something that could trickle down to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"n1_networking_chip\">N1 Networking Chip</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is likely to adopt the N1 networking chip that Apple first introduced in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe N1 chip is an Apple-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip that offers connectivity and efficiency improvements compared to the third-party chips that Apple has used in previous devices. The N1 supports the latest Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6 technology.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe current &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; offers Wi-Fi 6E support, so the next-generation model could see faster Wi-Fi speeds on compatible networks with Wi-Fi 7.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"apple_modem\">Apple Modem</h2>\r<br/>\nApple used the C1X in the M5 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and the cellular versions of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will get that same modem chip. The C1X is an upgraded variant of the C1, Apple's first in-house modem chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt offers performance on par with Qualcomm chips, though 5G connectivity is limited to sub-6GHz with no support for mmWave 5G. That's not an issue on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, because the current version of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; doesn't support mmWave.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's modem chips are much more power efficient than Qualcomm modem chips, and are able to better integrate with other &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; components.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h2>\r<br/>\nThere are no rumors of a price increase, so the 11-inch model is expected to continue to start at &#36;599, while the 13-inch model will start at &#36;799.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"launch_date\">Launch Date</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; could come out as soon as next week, ahead of Apple's March 4 Special Experience.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/24/m4-ipad-air-latest-rumors/\">M4 iPad Air: What&#039;s New and When It&#039;s Coming</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-ipad-air-whats-new-and-when-its-coming.2478188/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Over the past year, there have been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/08/iphone-18-pro-under-display-face-id/\">mixed rumors</a> about whether the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro models will continue to feature a &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; or have a hole punch camera with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-18-pro-under-screen-face-id-rumor/\">under screen Face ID</a> and no &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, but the latest information suggests we're <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/13/iphone-18-smaller-dynamic-island-rumor/\">not getting rid</a> of the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; just yet.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/Dynamic-Island-iPhone-18-Pro-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032978\" />\r<br/>\nAlong with <em>Bloomberg</em>, several prominent leakers on Weibo and other social media sites have said Apple will <a href=\"https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/2013628564223008849?s=20\">make the Dynamic Island smaller</a>, but won't eliminate it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/30/iphone-17-metalens-rumor/\">heard the same rumors</a> about a smaller <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a> &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; last year, but the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; ultimately ended up being the same size. Rumors about the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; have picked up in late 2025 and early 2026, and when we see a deluge of differently-sourced rumors about the same feature in the months leading up to a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s launch, those rumors are typically accurate.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMost of the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro rumors about under-display <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> and no &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; circulated earlier in 2025, so Apple either considered the feature for the 18 Pro lineup and pushed it back, or those rumors were just guessing. There also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/20/iphone-18-pro-leak-smaller-dynamic-island/\">may have been confusion</a> over what's moving under the display and what's not.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTo implement a smaller &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, Apple is rumored to be putting the &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; dot illuminator under the display, and rumors suggest the company is also implementing new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/07/iphone-18-pro-smaller-front-camera/\">camera miniaturization technology</a> that could cut down on the size of the front-facing camera. The front-facing camera, &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; dot projector, and infrared camera are expected to be housed in the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, and won't be under the display.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple does eventually want to create an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that's a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/11/apple-iphone-air-interview/\">slab of glass with no cutouts</a>, and we may see that for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/20th-anniversary-iphone/\">20th anniversary iPhone</a> planned for 2027, but it won't happen in fall 2026 with the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro models.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/\">iPhone 18</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/24/iphone-18-pro-smaller-dynamic-island/\">iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max Expected to Feature Smaller Dynamic Island</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-18-pro-and-pro-max-expected-to-feature-smaller-dynamic-island.2478186/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

As with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, the Mac &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; will be interactive and it will contextually expand based on the app or Mac feature in use.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is updating macOS to make it more touch friendly. Users will be able to tap or click on-screen elements, and controls will change based on input method. If a user taps on a menu bar item, for example, it will display a larger set of controls optimized for touch. Touch-based options will be integrated throughout macOS, and it will support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> features like pinch gestures for zooming in or out and fast scrolling.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe new &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; will be the first Mac that supports touch gestures on the display, despite Apple's insistence over the years that it would not bring touch-based technology to the Mac. Apple did experiment with an OLED Touch Bar in prior &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models, but ultimately removed it after it proved to be unpopular. Apple apparently is not going to advertise the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; as a touch-first device like the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and will let customers use touch and mouse gestures interchangeably for all functions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlong with a touchscreen and OLED display technology, the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; could have an updated design with a slimmed-down chassis, but it will look a lot like the current &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;. Apple is not removing the keyboard or the trackpad, and sizes aren't expected to change. Apple is planning for OLED versions of both the 14-inch and 16-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple plans to update the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips this spring, but the OLED &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models will adopt the M6 Pro and M6 Max chips, built on Apple's new 2-nanometer process.

Developers in these areas will face new age assurance and parental consent obligations, and Apple's APIs will help them meet these upcoming requirements.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/apple-developer-banner.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"572\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-757303\" />\r<br/>\nAs of February 24, Apple is blocking users in Australia, Brazil, and Singapore from downloading apps rated 18+ unless they have been confirmed to be adults through an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> age confirmation process that uses \"reasonable methods.\" Age confirmation is done automatically through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, but developers may also need to independently confirm their users are adults with the Declared Age Range API.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn Brazil, apps that have loot boxes will have their age rating adjusted to 18+ in the Brazilian storefront, as Brazil's new age-related app store laws prevent apps from offering loot boxes to children. Developers can see a user's age group when the user or user's parent opts to share it, with Apple including a new signal about the method of age assurance.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn Utah and Louisiana, there are upcoming regulations that require developers to establish a user's age with the Declared Age Range API to restrict children from downloading apps that are not age appropriate. Apple has updated the API to help developers determine whether age-related regulatory requirements apply to a user, and whether the user is required to share age range. There's also a new notice if an app is required to get a parent or guardian's permission for significant app updates for an app downloaded by a child.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn some cases, developers are required to inform parents when apps receive a major update with new functionality, and the parents have to provide permission for the child to use the app, even if permission was previously granted.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUtah's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Accountability Act requirement starts on May 6, 2026, while Louisiana's House Bill 570 begins on July 1, 2026, and both laws are applicable only to new Apple Accounts.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSeveral countries and U.S. states have started implementing strict child protection laws, some of which require app store operators like Apple to confirm user age and obtain parental consent before minors are allowed to download apps.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDevelopers can face fines for not complying with age assurance requirements. In Utah, for example, parents can recover damages of up to &#36;1,000 per violation, while Louisiana can fine developers up to &#36;10,000 per violation after a 45-day grace period.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple could also be fined millions of dollars for non-compliance in Brazil, Australia, and Singapore, where there are now platform-level requirements.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple fought against platform-level legislation because of the privacy issues raised by the age verification process. Apple does not want to verify age through methods like ID submission due to data collection concerns, and the company also does not want to share age information from every user with developers.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/24/apple-updated-age-assurance-requirements/\">Apple Now Blocks 18+ App Downloads in Australia, Brazil, and Singapore Without Age Assurance</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-blocks-18-app-downloads-in-australia-brazil-and-singapore-without-age-assurance.2478183/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Popular password management app 1Password is set to get more expensive, with prices increasing on March 27, 2026. In an email sent out to customers today, 1Password said subscription prices will be going up &#36;12 per year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/1password-deal-blue.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-846338\" />\r<br/>\nThe individual plan will be &#36;47.88, up from &#36;35.88, while the family plan will be &#36;71.88, up from &#36;59.88. Pricing per month for the individual plan works out to &#36;3.99 (up from &#36;2.99), while the family plan will be &#36;5.99 per month (up from &#36;4.99).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n1Password said that it needs to update its pricing to continue investing in new features and security updates.\r<br/>\n<blockquote>Since 2005, 1Password has been on a mission to make security simple, reliable, and accessible for everyone. As the way people work and live online has evolved, so has 1Password.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMore recently, we've invested significantly in new features that make 1Password even more powerful and effortless to use, helping protect what matters most to you, including:\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Automatic saving of logins and payment details</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Enhanced Watchtower alerts</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Faster, more secure device setup</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>AI-powered item naming</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Expanded recovery options</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Proactive phishing prevention</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nWhile 1Password has grown substantially in value and capability, our pricing has remained largely unchanged for many years. To continue investing in innovation and the world-class security you expect, we're updating pricing for [Individual/Family] plans, starting March 27, 2026.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nSubscribers can expect the new pricing to take effect at their next renewal on or after March 27, 2026. Subscription renewals that happen before March 27 will have the current pricing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn some locations, such as Europe, 1Password plans will be automatically canceled if customers do not approve the price increase.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple offers a free alternative to 1Password with the built-in Passwords app that it debuted as part of iOS 18, but the app uses <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> and is limited to Apple devices and Windows PCs with the &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; for Windows app. For those that need cross-platform support for use with Android devices, third-party apps like 1Password are the only option.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/1password/\">1Password</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/24/1password-march-price-increase/\">1Password Getting More Expensive Starting in March</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/1password-getting-more-expensive-starting-in-march.2478182/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

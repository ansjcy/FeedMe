      "content": "2025 was a significant year of advancement for Apple's software, with a noticeable focus on visual design, productivity, and communication.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/iOS-26-Glass-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1016183\" />\r<br/>\nWhile Apple introduced and continued to iterate on a wide range of features throughout the year, several additions stood out for their scope and practical impact across multiple devices. As the year comes to an end, these five new features provide a useful lens for weighing up what the company focused on this year and how far its platforms evolved in 2025.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Liquid Glass</h3>\r<br/>\nThis year's most immediately visible change is the introduction of Liquid Glass, a new system-wide visual design language applied across Apple's operating systems. Liquid Glass replaces many of the flat, opaque UI elements introduced over the past decade with layered translucency, subtle refraction, and motion-responsive surfaces that react to underlying content.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/Liquid-Glass-General-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1005959\" />\r<br/>\nNavigation bars, sidebars, control panels, and system overlays now appear as semi-transparent sheets that blend into their surroundings rather than sitting on top of them. Apple framed this as a unifying material across platforms rather than a purely aesthetic refresh, with the same visual logic appearing on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, Mac, Apple Watch, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn practice, it is one of Apple's biggest visual redesigns since the original iOS 7 shift away from skeuomorphism, and it signals a renewed focus on making the interface feel fresh, spatial, playful, and responsive rather than static.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Revamped iPad Multitasking</h3>\r<br/>\nOn the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, the most consequential change is the introduction of an all-new multitasking system with windows and a macOS-style Menu Bar and cursor in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iPadOS-26-App-Windowing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1006126\" />\r<br/>\nApps can now run in freely resizable windows rather than being constrained to fixed split-screen layouts, allowing multiple overlapping windows to coexist on screen. Alongside this, a Menu Bar appears at the top of the display when invoked, exposing app commands in a structured, searchable format similar to macOS. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nInstead of asking users to adapt desktop workflows to a touch-first model, Apple has now explicitly imported desktop interaction styles into iPadOS, addressing a significant number of user complaints about the software limitations of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. For users who want to use the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; with true multitasking and desktop-style workflows, this is one of the most substantive capability upgrades the platform has ever received.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>More Powerful Mac Spotlight</h3>\r<br/>\nOn the Mac, Spotlight received its most extensive overhaul to date, transforming it from a passive search tool into an actions-first command interface, similar to third-party apps like Alfred or Raycast. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/tahoe-spotlight.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1005000\" />\r<br/>\nSpotlight in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/\">macOS Tahoe</a> can now execute hundreds of actions directly from the search field. Users can create and edit notes, send emails and messages, start timers, run Shortcuts, adjust system settings, and perform app-specific commands, without opening the corresponding app.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple also redesigned Spotlight's results presentation with richer, more structured browsing views. Instead of returning a flat list of matches, Spotlight now surfaces grouped results for files, applications, actions, and suggestions, allowing users to scan and refine results more quickly.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSpotlight now includes a built-in clipboard history, allowing users to view and reuse previously copied text or images directly from the Spotlight interface. Apple also integrated an app library-style view, providing a centralized, searchable overview of all installed applications. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Live Translation</h3>\r<br/>\nAnother major addition is Live Translation. Real-time translation now operates inside Messages, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>, and the Phone app, translating both text and spoken audio during conversations. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/AirPods-Live-Translation.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1025657\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn Messages, incoming and outgoing text can be translated inline. In &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj;, Live Translation provides real-time translated captions during video calls, allowing participants to speak naturally while reading translations as the conversation unfolds. In phone calls, spoken dialogue can be translated in near real time, with translated audio and on-screen text presented during the call.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple also extended Live Translation to AirPods, enabling real-time spoken translation directly through the earbuds during in-person conversations. When Live Translation is active, speech from another language can be translated on the paired &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and played back in the user's AirPods, while the user's responses can be translated and spoken aloud by the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; for the other participant. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Communication Screening and Hold Assist</h3>\r<br/>\nCall Screening allows the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to automatically answer calls from unknown numbers on the user's behalf. The system asks the caller to identify themselves and explain the reason for the call, then presents the user with a live transcript of the response before the call is connected.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith Hold Assist, when a user is placed on hold during a phone call, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can remain in the queue on their behalf and monitor the call until a live agent becomes available. Once the system detects that the call has resumed, it notifies the user to return to the conversation. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn Messages, Apple introduced more aggressive screening for unknown senders. Messages from numbers that are not in the user's contacts are automatically routed into a separate area, keeping potential spam and scam attempts out of the main conversation list.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/30/5-most-important-software-features-introduced-this-year/\">The 5 Most Important Apple Software Features Introduced This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/the-5-most-important-apple-software-features-introduced-this-year.2475363/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Over the last few weeks, iRobot has added Matter support to more of its Roomba robot vacuums, allowing them to be integrated with the Home app and used with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> voice commands.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/irobot-roomba-vacuum.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031055\" />\r<br/>\nMatter integration has been available for the Roomba Combo 10 Max since earlier this year, but existing Roomba Plus 500 Combo, Roomba Max 700 Vac, and Roomba Max 700 Combo vacuums can get Matter support <a href=\"https://homesupport.irobot.com/s/article/1606\">through a firmware update</a>. Matter has not yet been re-added for the Roomba Combo J7 and J9.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMatter-enabled Roomba vacuums can be added to the Home app on devices running iOS 18.4 or higher, as long as a Home hub is available (<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>). The Home app doesn't support the full suite of features available with robot vacuums, but basic commands are available. Vacuums can be set to vacuum and mop an entire home, or a specific room or area with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; voice commands.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOnce added to the Home app, a Roomba vacuum with Matter can be set to clean automatically with automations and can integrate with other <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> devices. You could, for example, set the Roomba to vacuum whenever you leave the house, or at a certain time. Automations can be triggered by presence, time, sensors, or when an accessory like a light is activated.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple added support for Matter-connected robot vacuums in iOS 18.4 earlier this year. Several companies have since come out with Matter options, including Roborock, Ecovacs, Switchbot, and Roomba.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\niRobot's added Matter support comes as the company <a href=\"https://investor.irobot.com/news-releases/news-release-details/irobot-announces-strategic-transaction-drive-long-term-growth\">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> earlier in December. iRobot has been sold to Picea Robotics, a Chinese company that already manufactures some of the Roomba devices. The acquisition is expected to be completed by February 2026, and iRobot says there will be no disruption in app functionality, product support, or customer programs.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGoing forward, iRobot will remain a private company owned by Picea, and the Roomba brand will continue with new models planned for the future.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<em>(Thanks, Max!)</em><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/matter/\">Matter</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/29/roomba-vacuums-matter-integration/\">More Roomba Vacuums Get Matter Support for HomeKit Integration</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/more-roomba-vacuums-get-matter-support-for-homekit-integration.2475340/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple is rumored to be introducing a foldable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> in September 2026, and since it will bring the biggest form factor change since the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; was introduced in 2007, curiosity about the design is high. A 3D designer <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/23/have-a-3d-printer-you-can-make-your-own-iphone-fold-dummy/\">created an iPhone Fold design</a> based on rumors, and we printed it out to see how it compares to Apple's current iPhones.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLiz-FQfb2s\" title=\"This Is the Closest Look Yet at Apple’s Foldable iPhone\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br/>\nThe foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is going to be smaller than any current &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; when it's closed, and it'll be shorter than Samsung's Galaxy foldables. Rumors suggest it'll be somewhere around 5.4 inches, which would make it as small as the now-discontinued &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 mini.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen open, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold will be somewhere around 7.6 inches. It'll be smaller than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, but the display will be larger than any &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to date. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold will be short and wide, for a book-like form factor and usage experience with a 4:3 aspect ratio.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe don't know the dimensions of the foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; yet, and rumors vary somewhat, so the 3D print isn't an exact representation of the device that Apple has in the works. The 3D model was <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rumoured-iphone-fold-size-concept-drawing-and-renders.2456447/\">based on a mockup</a> created by <em>MacRumors</em> reader iZac, who based his design on rumors that were circulating in May. He mocked up a 5.49-inch display when the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is closed, and a 7.76-inch display when it's open. There are no sizing rumors that are significantly off from those figures, but we've heard 5.3 to 5.5 inches for the outer (closed) display, and 7.6 to 7.8 inches for the inner (open) display.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\niZac's design also uses a 4.8mm thickness for the device when it's unfolded, and rumors about thickness vary too. It could be 4.8mm, or it could be as thin as 4.5mm.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe hinge on the 3D print is just a stand-in, because we don't know what Apple's hinge will look like. Rumors suggest that Apple spent a lot of time and effort creating a hinge that will make the crease between the two halves of the device almost invisible. We also don't know what the camera area will look like. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEven though the 3D print isn't a spot on representation of the device that Apple is planning to launch, it's close enough to the rumors to provide a good idea of how the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold will look and feel in the hand.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDo you plan to get an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold?

      "content": "Apple has asked the UK Court of Appeal to overturn a £1.5 billion (&#36;1.76 billion) antitrust ruling that found the company overcharged millions of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> users, escalating one of the most significant competition cases ever brought against the company in the country (via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/26/apple-seeks-to-appeal-15bn-ruling-it-overcharged-uk-customers\"><em>The Guardian</em></a>).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/app-store-blue-banner-uk-fixed.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1794\" height=\"1009\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-804521\" />\r<br/>\nThe application follows a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/23/apple-loses-uk-app-store-lawsuit/\">decision in October</a> by the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), which concluded that Apple abused its dominant position by charging excessive commissions on &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; purchases between 2015 and 2024. The tribunal found that Apple's control over app distribution on iPhones and iPads allowed it to impose commission rates of up to 30% that were higher than would have prevailed in a competitive market, resulting in consumer harm estimated to be worth £1.5 billion.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe case was raised as a collective action on behalf of approximately 36 million British consumers. Under UK collective proceedings law, eligible consumers are automatically included unless they opt out, meaning that anyone in the UK who made &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; purchases during the relevant period could be entitled to compensation if the ruling stands.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn its judgment, CAT said Apple should have charged lower commissions, estimating that rates of around 17.5% on app sales and 10% on in-app purchases would have been more appropriate. The tribunal acknowledged that this assessment relied on \"informed guesswork\" based on the evidence presented.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple strongly disputes that approach. After the October ruling, the company sought permission from CAT to appeal, but the tribunal <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/13/apple-denied-appeal-app-store-ruling/\">refused in November</a>, concluding that Apple had not met the legal threshold to challenge its decision. Apple has now applied directly to the Court of Appeal, which has the authority to grant permission even where CAT has declined.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple said it disagrees with the ruling and argues that the tribunal took a flawed view of the app economy. In a previous statement responding to the decision, the company said the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; operates in a \"thriving and competitive app economy\" and provides developers and consumers with security, privacy protections, and access to a large marketplace. Apple also noted that most developers now pay a reduced 15% commission and that the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; facilitated more than &#36;55 billion in sales in the UK last year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf Apple's appeal is rejected and the ruling is upheld, the £1.5 billion award will be distributed among eligible UK consumers, with individual payouts likely to be relatively small but collectively significant. <div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/29/apple-appeals-uk-antitrust-ruling/\">Apple Appeals &#36;1.8 Billion UK Antitrust Ruling Over App Store Fees</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-appeals-1-8-billion-uk-antitrust-ruling-over-app-store-fees.2475327/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

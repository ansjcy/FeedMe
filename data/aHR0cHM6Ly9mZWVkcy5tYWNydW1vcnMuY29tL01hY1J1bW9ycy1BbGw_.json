      "content": "If you're looking for the perfect tech or tech-adjacent present for someone who loves Apple products or just uses them daily, I have a few suggestions that might be helpful to you this holiday season.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/Holiday-Gift-Guide-Shelf-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029289\" />\r<br/>\nThese are some of our favorite products, many of which I use personally or have gifted to our friends and family members in the past. If you're still looking for a present for someone that's hard to shop for, check out the list.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"maclock\"><a href=\"https://kokogol.com\">Maclock</a></h2>\r<br/>\nFor Apple fans or fans of classic PCs, <a href=\"https://kokogol.com\">the Maclock</a> is a tiny Macintosh 128K that works as an alarm clock. It is super detailed and has all of the design touches of the original, and there's even a tiny floppy disk that turns it on when you put it in.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/maclock.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1306\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029312\" />\r<br/>\nThere are multiple display modes, and it can tell you the time, day of the week, and temperature, plus it is a functional alarm clock. There's also a classic Mac face you can set it to. I haven't gifted it yet, but I bought one of these a few weeks ago. It does ship from China, so order ASAP.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI've seen a few different versions of this product, but this variant has no third-party logo on the front, <a href=\"https://kokogol.com\">and it's just &#36;30</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf you want to spend a bit more, RayCue has some <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRayCue-Docking-Station-Monitor-Ethernet%2Fdp%2FB0D9Y14M5J\">retro-style Macs</a> that are actually designed to be docks. I haven't used one, but it looks like a fun desktop accessory.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/raycue-mac-hub.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029313\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"pico-mac-nano\"><a href=\"https://www.1bitrainbow.com/parts-store.php?cPath=972_973\">Pico-Mac-Nano</a></h2>\r<br/>\nWhile I'm on the subject of mini Macs, I don't want to leave out the <a href=\"https://blog.1bitrainbow.com/pico-mac-nano/\">Pico-Mac-Nano from Nick Gillard</a>. The Maclock is palm-sized, but the nano is even smaller at just under 2.5 inches, plus it has an actual Mac operating system. Gillard did sell these fully assembled at one point, but Apple asked him to stop.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003314\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/Pico-Mac-Nano.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br/>\nYou can still <a href=\"https://www.1bitrainbow.com/parts-store.php?cPath=972_973\">get the parts to make one</a>, and Gillard has instructions. There's <a href=\"https://www.1bitrainbow.com/parts-store.php?cPath=972_973_P4485\">a full kit for GBP62.00</a> (around &#36;100 shipped to the U.S.), and it would be a great gift for someone who likes retro items and a project.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"aura_frames\"><a href=\"https://auraframes.com\">Aura Frames</a></h2>\r<br/>\nPriced starting at &#36;149, <a href=\"https://auraframes.com\">Aura digital frames</a> make a good gift for anyone who has digital photos, which is most of us these days. You can load photos on the frame using the Aura <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> app, and since images are stored in the cloud, there's no limit.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-976379\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/aura-frames.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1111\" height=\"625\" />\r<br/>\nMultiple people can upload images to a single frame, so it's a great way to share photos with friends and family members. If you know someone that's not technically savvy, like a grandparent, it's still the perfect gift because you can load photos for them remotely. The &#36;149 10.1-inch Carver is Aura's most affordable option, but there are sizes up to 15 inches, like the &#36;299 Walden. Aura also makes higher resolution options, including the &#36;199 Mason, and all the frames come in multiple colors to match any decor.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-926668\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/aura-frame-bright.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nEveryone I've gifted an Aura frame to has loved it, and it's my go-to for people that are hard to shop for. This year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/21/aura-e-paper-photo-frame/\">Aura launched a frame</a> that uses e-ink for a softer, more art-like look. It changes images less often and it's <a href=\"https://auraframes.com/ink#features\">expensive at &#36;449</a>, but it has a different vibe than your standard photo frame.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024094\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/aura-ink-frame.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1218\" height=\"685\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"lego_retro_radio\"><a href=\"https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/retro-radio-10334\">LEGO Retro Radio</a></h2>\r<br/>\nPriced at &#36;100, the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLEGO-Transistors-Compartment-Integration-10334%2Fdp%2FB0D738JLYR\">Retro Radio from LEGO</a> has a sweet, nostalgic design, complete with a tuner, knobs, and speaker grille. It's actually functional, because you can remove the back plate from the set and place an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; inside so that the radio plays music.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-980076\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/lego-retro-radio.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThere's a built-in smartphone stand that holds the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in place, but if you don't want to use an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, there's also a little sound brick that plays different sounds when you turn the knob. I have one of these, and it was a fun build.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/lego-gameboy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029321\" />\r<br/>\nThere are other LEGO sets that make for good gifts, even for people who aren't LEGO collectors. Anyone that likes a puzzle would probably like a LEGO set, and some have wide appeal. Here are a few I've gotten this year that would make for good gifts:\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n <li><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLEGO-Super-Mario-Game-Boy%2Fdp%2FB0DX3J6MT7\">LEGO Super Mario Game Boy</a> (&#36;60) - This isn't a working Game Boy, unfortunately, but it does come with swappable screens and LEGO game cartridges. It <em>is</em> possible to <a href=\"https://blog.nataliethenerd.com/i-turned-the-lego-game-boy-into-a-working-game-boy-part-1/\">make a working version</a> if you're so inclined.</li>\r<br/>\n <li><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLEGO-Botanicals-Happy-Plants-Building%2Fdp%2FB0DRW6C2RF\">LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants</a> (&#36;19) - I'm a fan of the LEGO botanicals, and this set is small, inexpensive, and fun for the desktop.</li>\r<br/>\n <li><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLEGO-6529393-TBD-Botanicals-10372%2Fdp%2FB0DRW5M6XK\">LEGO Botanicals Hibiscus</a> (&#36;70) - All of the LEGO botanicals make good gifts (I'm gifting a set of flowers <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLEGO-Building-Project-Beautiful-Display%2Fdp%2FB08HVXZW8X\">and a bonsai</a> this year), but the hibiscus is a newer set that has a unique flower shape and it comes with a pot so it matches sets <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLEGO-Orchid-Building-Adults-Display%2Fdp%2FB09Q4L157D%2F\">like the orchid</a>. Other great botanical options include <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLEGO-Botanicals-Bonsai-Trees-Puzzle%2Fdp%2FB0DRW8G3WK\">the mini bonsais</a> and the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLEGO-Botanicals-Tiny-Plants-Artificial%2Fdp%2FB0CDCL6Y5T%2F\">tiny plants set</a> (a personal favorite).</li>\r<br/>\n <li><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLEGO-Kingfisher-Creative-Relaxing-Enthusiasts%2Fdp%2FB0CGY3343Z\">LEGO Kingfisher</a> (&#36;40) - This set was a lot of fun to put together, and it makes a great desk display because of its bright colors. It would be nice for a bird lover.</li>\r<br/>\n <li><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLEGO-Collection-Life-Size-Butterfly-Hercules%2Fdp%2FB0BXQ6MMZD\">LEGO Insects</a> (&#36;63) - This set has a butterfly, a Hercules beetle, and a praying mantis, and it's another excellent display piece. This one is delicate and can be a little frustrating, but it's one of my favorites in the ideas series.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nI do buy LEGO set gifts for people who aren't into LEGO and who haven't done one before, and it tends to go over well.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"nanoleaf_display_boxes\"><a href=\"https://nanoleaf.me/\">Nanoleaf Display Boxes</a></h2>\r<br/>\nEarlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/nanoleaf-expo-display-cases/\">I reviewed</a> the Nanoleaf LED Expo Display Cases, and they're one of my favorite Nanoleaf products to date. They're <a href=\"https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/nanoleaf-expo-display-case/\">far from cheap at &#36;270</a>, but they would make an excellent gift for someone that collects high-end sneakers, anime figures, or anything in that vein. The boxes can be set to 16 million colors or shades of white, and colors can change in time with music.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/nanoleaf-display-case-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-961156\" />\r<br/>\nI think Nanoleaf designed these for sneaker collectors, but anything can be put inside. Like a lot of Nanoleaf devices, these aren't going to go with every decor choice, but collectors and gamers will love them.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/nanoleaf-display-case-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1456\" height=\"816\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-961155\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"airpods\"><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/\">AirPods</a></h2>\r<br/>\nYou'll never go wrong with AirPods as a gift, and there are two really good options to choose from this year. The AirPods Pro were just refreshed with a third-generation version, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/?campaign=true\">and for &#36;249</a>, you get excellent Active Noise Cancellation and sound quality.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/airpods-pro-3-new-blue.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1021870\" />\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/\">AirPods Pro 3</a> have a new design that's more ergonomic and foam-infused silicone tips that fit snugly in the ears to drown out sound. With hearing aid support, &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; could be useful for a family member that has mild hearing loss but doesn't wear hearing aids.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf you're purchasing for someone who doesn't like silicone ear tips, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airpods/airpods-4\">the AirPods 4 are an option</a>. You can get them with or without Active Noise Cancellation. The ANC version doesn't cut out as much noise as the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj;, but it's enough to make a difference.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-972562\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/airpods-4-blue.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a> with ANC are <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGJ7HYG1\">a steal at &#36;99 from Amazon</a> right now, so it's not even worth getting the non-ANC version.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI prefer the AirPods Pro fit and ANC over the &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; because I have smaller ears and the &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; can be painful. The AirPods Pro can drown out the sound of the heater, leaf blowing outside, the TV in the next room, road noise, and other sounds that sometimes drive me nuts. The &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; are so inexpensive, though, that they're a great option on a budget.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"philips_hue_lights\"><a href=\"https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us\">Philips Hue Lights</a></h2>\r<br/>\nI think I've tried every <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> smart bulb and light available at this point, and <a href=\"https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us\">Philips Hue lights</a> are the best you can get. I have no patience for lights that constantly disconnect or have connectivity issues, and the Hue bulbs don't. <a href=\"https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-bridge-pro/046677582111\">There is a &#36;65 to &#36;100 Bridge</a>, but it's worth it. I mostly use Hue lights, and I've invested hundreds of dollars in my setup over time. Bulbs I have from almost 10 years ago are still functional.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-963771\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/philips-hue-sync-box-8k.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-starter-kit-2-e26-smart-bulbs-60-w/046677562915\">&#36;143 White and Color Starter Kit</a> comes with two Hue bulbs that can go in any lamp that supports E26 bulbs, and it comes with the hub. It's one of the best bets if you're buying a gift for someone who is new to smart home products. The bulbs can be controlled with the Home app or the Hue app, and they can be set to 16 million colors. Hue has great light effects and scenes that really shine when you have multiple bulbs.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-932254\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/hue-pendant.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor a cheaper option, there's <a href=\"https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-essential-starter-kit-4-e26-smart-bulbs-800-lm/046677608989\">the &#36;99 Essentials Starter Kit</a> that comes with a hub and four lower-power E26 multi-color bulbs. Hue Essentials bulbs don't dim quite as low and the color isn't as precise.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-932259\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/hue-go-lamp-orange-grip.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/products/smart-light-bulbs?filters=FK_HUE_LIGHTING_BULB_TYPE_LIGHTGUIDE&page=1\">Lightguide bulbs</a> (&#36;99) - These are perfect paired with a simple lamp base, because the bulb is meant to be the star. I have two of the ellipse bulbs, and they're enormous and look great.</li>\r<br/>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/products/string-lights\">String lights</a> (&#36;132) - For holiday fans or those with patio setups crying out for lighting, the Hue Festavia String Lights would make a good gift.</li>\r<br/>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-signe-gradient-floor-lamp/046677803513\">Signe floor lamp</a> (&#36;363) - The Signe floor lamp isn't the most practical light because it doesn't have a wide radius and is meant to face the wall, but it makes for great accent lighting.</li>\r<br/>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-go-portable-accent-light/7602031U7\">Hue Go</a> (&#36;99) - The Hue Go is a portable lamp that you can use plugged in or with the built-in battery, and it supports all of the same features as Hue bulbs. It's a nice accent light and good to have around for power outages.</li>\r<br/>\n <li><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPhilips-Portable-Ambiance-Compatible-Assistant%2Fdp%2FB0BG99KDKP\">Hue Go Portable Table Lamp</a> - This is a lot like the Hue Go, but it's a more traditional looking lamp. It's water resistant, so it can go outdoors, too. I haven't tried this one yet, but it's on the wishlist.</li>\r<br/>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-downlight-4-inch/046677578411\">Downlights</a> (&#36;66) - If you know someone that has those old can style downlights, a Hue upgrade would make a good gift. Downlights are super simple to swap out, and switching from the older models to Hue saves money and adds new lighting options. I switched all the downlights in my house to Hue and have no regrets.</li>\r<br/>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/products/smart-outdoor-lights\">Outdoor Lights</a> (&#36;176+) - I swapped my porch lights and the lights in the back to Hue lights this year. It's more involved than downlight swaps, but provides fun lighting options for the holidays. I installed <a href=\"https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-appear-outdoor-wall-light/1746330V7\">two of the Appear</a> and three of the <a href=\"https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-econic-outdoor-wall-light/1743830V7\">Econic</a>, all of which have been working flawlessly. I use these with motion detectors. Hue also has some <a href=\"https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-hue-festavia-globe-outdoor-string-lights-91-ft/046677591441\">Festavia globe outdoor lights</a> that look amazing, but I haven't tried them.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"bambu_lab_3d_printer\"><a href=\"https://bambulab.com/en-us\">Bambu Lab 3D Printer</a></h2>\r<br/>\nBambu Lab makes a range of 3D printers that you can print to using just an app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or your Mac. The <a href=\"https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/a1-mini?skr=yes\">A1 Mini is just &#36;219</a>, or &#36;329 with the <a href=\"https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/a1-mini?skr=yes&id=579551171554607116\">AMS Lite</a> that lets you print with up to four filament colors. Bambu's printers are sort of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; of 3D printers in that they're relatively easy to operate and have a lot of bells and whistles to streamline printing and cut down on issues. Models <a href=\"https://us.store.bambulab.com/collections/3d-printer\">like the H2S</a> and <a href=\"https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/p2s\">P2S</a> come with an enclosure, and there are now several machines like the <a href=\"https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/h2d?from=navigation&id=581025672340709390\">H2D</a> that also have a laser cutting module.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-976384\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/bambu-3d-printer-a1-mini.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1203\" />\r<br/>\nI've had a Bambu X1C for over two years now and do not hesitate to recommend Bambu printers for those interested in getting into 3D printing. It's easy to use, there are thousands of STLs out there for making everything you can think of, and you can even make your own using software like Tinkercad, Fusion 360, or even Nomad Sculpt on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>. I use my 3D printer weekly, if not daily, and Bambu printers get better all the time with new print options from <a href=\"https://makerworld.com/en\">Makerworld</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-976385\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/bambu-3d-printer-x1c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1012\" />\r<br/>\nI haven't personally used the A1 Mini, but it's a much more affordable way to try 3D printing, and it could make a great gift for an older child or a partner who likes to tinker. They're not entirely problem free, but I've been able to solve every issue I've run into, and there are endless settings to optimize.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"portable_anker_chargers\"><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAnker-Power-Built-Retractable-USB-C%2Fdp%2FB0DGKWTQQC\">Portable Anker Chargers</a></h2>\r<br/>\nI reviewed portable power banks from several different brands this year, and I have two favorites that I keep coming back to from Anker.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023745\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/anker-battery-pack-design.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nI love the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAnker-Ultra-Slim-Certified-Ultra-Fast-MagSafe-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB0F8J4WK57\">&#36;54 MagGo Nano Power Bank</a> for wireless charging. It's the slimmest <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> power bank that I've tried, and it's so much better than thicker, bulkier models. I have a 17 Pro Max and it doesn't bother me to use it with the power bank attached because it doesn't add too much extra weight. It's only a 5,000 mAh battery so I don't get a full charge, but it's more than enough to get me through a day of heavy phone usage.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy other favorite is the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAnker-Power-Built-Retractable-USB-C%2Fdp%2FB0DGKWTQQC\">&#36;60 Nano Power Bank with Retractable Cable</a>. I didn't love this one right when I tried it because it's thick and rectangular, but it's turned out to be the power bank that I reach for most often. I like the lanyard, and the retractable USB-C cable is useful because I never need to hunt one down. I tend to prefer this power bank even over the magnetic model because the wired charging is much faster. Next time there's a sale, I plan to pick up another in teal.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023748\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/anker-brick-charger-size.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"ugreen_uno_chargers\"><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2FUGREEN%2FUGREENUnoSeries_NexodeSeries%2Fpage%2F488CA5D7-F4E6-42B7-97AB-EA509E3BAAD7\">Ugreen Uno Chargers</a></h2>\r<br/>\nUgreen's <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2FUGREEN%2FUGREENUnoSeries_NexodeSeries%2Fpage%2F488CA5D7-F4E6-42B7-97AB-EA509E3BAAD7\">\"Uno\" line</a> features chargers with fun little faces, and I think they're great.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-964026\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ugreen-uno-series.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1491\" height=\"839\" />\r<br/>\nThere's a <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook%2Fdp%2FB0C6DX66TN\">&#36;35 65W charger</a> with four ports, which has legs and a digital panel with face emoji that change based on charging state. When a device is fast charging, for example, there's a face that looks like it has its mouth full, and when charging is finished, there's a little face with sunglasses. I've used this one on my desktop power strip for the last year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-964028\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ugreen-uno-power-bank.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br/>\nThere are also two power banks that have the little emoji faces, <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUGREEN-Magnetic-Portable-Charging-Foldable%2Fdp%2FB0D228PXC7%2Fref%3Dast_sto_dp_puis\">one that's 5,000 mAh with Qi2 for &#36;35</a>, and one that's <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUGREEN-Portable-Charger-Charging-Battery%2Fdp%2FB0D1XKS2LP\">10,000 mAh with USB-C</a> for &#36;50. They come with built-in stands that look like little headphones, which is a nice touch because you can use the stand for watching videos or FaceTiming. When I want to charge and need a stand, I use these.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"nimbles_wall_chargers\"><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/hs602ll/a/nimble-wally-stretch-65w-wall-charger-deep-purple\">Nimble's Wall Chargers</a></h2>\r<br/>\nNimble has &#36;42 <a href=\"https://www.gonimble.com/collections/wall-chargers-adapters\">65W Wally Wall Chargers</a> that come with a retractable 2-foot USB-C cable, and I love them. The prongs fold down and the cable retracts inside the enclosure, so they're ideal for travel. I have a cat that likes to nibble cables, and these keep the cable out of the way unless I'm charging. There's an extra USB-C port at the bottom so you can actually charge two devices at once.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/nimble-usb-c-charger.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029323\" />\r<br/>\nIf you <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/hs602ll/a/nimble-wally-stretch-65w-wall-charger-deep-purple\">buy them from Apple</a>, you can get fun colors that include deep purple or teal, though they're more expensive at &#36;60. Nimble also <a href=\"https://www.gonimble.com/collections/portable-battery-chargers/products/champ-portable-charger-limited-edition\">has power banks</a> in colors you don't often see, and I am a fan, but I don't love having to supply my own USB-C cable.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"bird_buddy\"><a href=\"https://mybirdbuddy.com\">Bird Buddy</a></h2>\r<br/>\nAvailable <a href=\"https://mybirdbuddy.com/shop/\">starting at &#36;99</a>, the <a href=\"https://mybirdbuddy.com/\">Bird Buddy</a> is the kind of gift that almost anyone will like, which makes it great for the person that has everything. It's a Wi-Fi connected smart bird feeder that sends you pictures of the birds that come to visit.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-959300\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-main-image.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1630\" height=\"917\" />\r<br/>\nYou'll need to fill it with seed regularly and charge it up when necessary, but other than that, it operates on its own. To do away with charging, I recommend the solar version, which starts at &#36;149.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-959311\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-snapshots.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1317\" />\r<br/>\nI've gifted the Bird Buddy and it's been a huge hit, with adults and kids too.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"birdfy_bird_feeders\"><a href=\"https://www.birdfy.com/products/birdfy-feeder\">Birdfy Bird Feeders</a></h2>\r<br/>\nBirdfy is a lot like Bird Buddy, but it has product options that Bird Buddy doesn't offer. You can get a standard Bird Feeder for the <a href=\"https://www.birdfy.com/products/birdfy-feeder\">same &#36;99 price</a> as Bird Buddy, but if you're willing to spend a little more, there's a bigger version with multiple cameras.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/birdfy-duo-feeder.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1382\" height=\"778\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029341\" />\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.birdfy.com/products/birdfy-feeder-2-duo\">&#36;330 Birdfy Feeder 2 Duo</a> has a triple-lens camera, including a dual-lens front camera and a second side camera to capture birds from every angle. It holds more seed than a standard version and comes with a solar panel. If you've gifted someone a Bird Buddy and they love it, this is the next upgrade option.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBirdfy also <a href=\"https://www.birdfy.com/products/birdfy-bath-pro?variant=50324900970776\">sells the Bath Pro</a>, which is a solar-powered smart birdbath with a camera. It's priced starting at &#36;200 and lets you get photos of birds bathing and drinking. In some areas of the U.S., people in apartments and condos aren't able to put out bird feeders because of rats and pigeons. This is an excellent gift for someone that wants to attract birds but isn't able to have a feeder, but it's also great for avid birders.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/birdfy-bird-bath.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029342\" />\r<br/>\nWith bird feeders, you often need a specific kind of food to attract the birds you want, but a bird bath has more universal appeal.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"govee_light_projectors\"><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGovee-Projector-Flowing-Effects-Assistant%2Fdp%2FB0D9JBGWCL%2F\">Govee Light Projectors</a></h2>\r<br/>\nGovee came out with some Matter-enabled projectors this year that can project stars or ocean scenes onto the walls and ceiling. I've been testing these for a month or so and have a review coming soon, but I think the lower-priced models would make a good gift.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/govee-light-projector.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1776\" height=\"1000\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029343\" />\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGovee-Projector-Flowing-Effects-Assistant%2Fdp%2FB0D9JBGWCL%2Fref%3Dsr_1_7\">&#36;56 Star Light Projector</a> has different night sky light effects paired with laser stars, while the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGovee-Projector-Flowing-Effects-Assistant%2Fdp%2FB0D9JBGWCL%2F\">&#36;50 Ocean version</a> has more of an under-the-sea vibe. There's a <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGovee-Galaxy-Projector-Megapixel-Planetarium%2Fdp%2FB0FL29G4R4%2F\">&#36;180 Pro model</a> with swappable galaxy scenes and laser stars, but it's really best for the real space projector enthusiast.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"robot_vacuums\"><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FECOVACS-DEEBOT-X11-OmniCyclone-Self-Washing%2Fdp%2FB0FJRZGDNY\">Robot Vacuums</a></h2>\r<br/>\nI tested several Matter-enabled robot vacuums this year, and I am sold. These are excellent at vacuuming and mopping, and can be real time savers. I particularly liked the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FECOVACS-DEEBOT-X11-OmniCyclone-Self-Washing%2Fdp%2FB0FJRZGDNY\">Deebot X11 Omnicyclone</a>, the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FECOVACS-DEEBOT-PRO-Self-Washing-ZeroTangleTM%2Fdp%2FB0DZXFNVQ2%2F\">Deebot X9 Pro</a>, and the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Froborock-Saros-10R-Zero-Tangling-Self-Emptying%2Fdp%2FB0DHCJ571Z\">Roborock Saros 10R</a>. Some of these are over &#36;1,100, but you get what you pay for.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1016903\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/ecovacs-x11-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nI've tested some lower-cost versions and have a review in the works, but the lower-end models I've used lack the navigation capabilities of the more expensive versions and add a lot more frustration to the cleaning process. Not all brands are the same, though, so it's worth some research on the best option.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"epson_ecotank_photo_et-8550\"><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/2aPa9D\">Epson EcoTank Photo ET-8550</a></h2>\r<br/>\nFor printing photos, Epson's printers are some of the best, though Canon has its fans too. I recently got <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/2aPa9D\">the EcoTank Photo ET-8550</a>, and I think it's a great option if you want to get your images off of your phone.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/epson-ecotank-printer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1380\" height=\"776\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029344\" />\r<br/>\nIt's normally &#36;800, but Best Buy has it for &#36;500 right now. EcoTank printers are more expensive than your standard printer because the ink is cheap. These use refillable liquid ink rather than printer cartridges, and that is the main reason why I chose this model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEpson has to make its on the printer upfront because the ink lasts so much longer and is so much more affordable. There are <a href=\"https://epson.com/ecotank-ink-tank-printers\">other EcoTank printers</a> that aren't as expensive, but this one is optimized for images and prints at up to 13\"x19\".\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"plant_grow_lights\"><a href=\"https://modernsprout.com/pages/grow-lights\">Plant Grow Lights</a></h2>\r<br/>\nAn iPhone-connected light is a great gift for someone that's into plants, and you will never go wrong with a light for an indoor plant collector.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/modern-sprout-light.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1300\" height=\"730\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029345\" />\r<br/>\nI like Modern Sprout light options for the clean aesthetic. There's <a href=\"https://modernsprout.com/collections/grow-lights\">a &#36;90 light bar</a>, a <a href=\"https://modernsprout.com/products/smart-growhouse\">&#36;200 grow house</a> ideal for the kitchen counter, and a <a href=\"https://modernsprout.com/products/smart-landscape-growframe\">&#36;270 Growframe</a> that goes on the wall. The app lets you set the brightness and the schedule for the lights, which is essential.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAerogarden is <a href=\"https://aerogarden.com/led-grow-lights\">also a good option</a>, with prices that start at &#36;16. I have the <a href=\"https://aerogarden.com/grow-lights/all-lighting/tabletop-grow-light.html\">&#36;50 AeroGarden Tabletop Grow Light</a> that I've been using for a few years, and it works well. The lights are programmable with the Aerogarden app.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"349_ipad_and_apple_pencil\"><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad\">&#36;349 iPad and Apple Pencil</a></h2>\r<br/>\nFor someone who is creative or wants to get into drawing, 3D sculpting, modeling, or similar, an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> is the best possible gift. Apps like ProCreate and Nomad Sculpt are powerful, and the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; gives you a level of control that's hard to get on a Mac or PC.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/new-ipad-blue.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-998412\" />\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; does a lot and it's an ideal gift for anyone, but it could really spark the creativity of an artistic child, or provide a new medium for an adult that already likes to sketch and draw. I have an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> with an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro, but all of Apple's iPads can be used with an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, even <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ipad-11/\">the &#36;349 model</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/\">&#36;499 iPad mini</a> is the best for something to use on the go, and the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/\">&#36;899 13-inch iPad Air</a> is a good option if you want the biggest screen without paying &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; prices.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"gift_suggestions\">Gift Suggestions</h2>\r<br/>\nHave a great product suggestion we don't have in our list?

      "content": "For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with GRID Studio to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> from Apple. <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/\">GRID Studio</a> is a company that takes discarded Apple devices and turns them into collectible art for Apple fans.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/grid-studio-grid-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2528\" height=\"1422\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029292\" />\r<br/>\nIf you're still looking for holiday gifts, GRID Studio has a Christmas sale going on this week. You can get 20 percent off site wide with promo code CM20, and there are also deeper discounts on select items.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation\">iPhone 2G is available for &#36;299</a>, down from &#36;399. The GRID 2G is one of the most popular devices that GRID Studio sells, because it showcases the first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> that Apple made. It highlights all of the components that were in the original 2007 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, including the curved shell, power button, headphone socket, speaker, logic board, and ear piece.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/grid-iPhone2G.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-909376\" />\r<br/>\nApple's original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; was made well before Apple started manufacturing its own chips, so there are some unique components to reminisce about.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE4s\">iPhone 4s is available for &#36;99</a>, down from &#36;139. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4S was the last &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; introduced during Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' lifetime, and it was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> released without Jobs. It was the fifth &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that Apple came out with, and in the name, the \"S\" stood for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4S was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that included Apple's personal assistant.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/grid-studio-grid-4s.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2730\" height=\"1536\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029293\" />\r<br/>\nCompared to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4S included an upgraded A5 chip, an 8-megapixel camera, and up to 64GB of storage. It ran iOS 5, a major operating system update that brought features like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> and iMessage. All of the internal components from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4S are thoughtfully arranged in GRID Studio's piece, and there's even a look at the default app arrangement that was available at the time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGRID has the <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-5\">iPhone 5 available for &#36;109</a>, down from &#36;139. The GRID 5 highlights the 2012 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5, which was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that was developed under Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; and the last &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that Apple CEO Steve Jobs was involved with. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5 is an important part of Apple's history because it included a taller 4-inch display, and it was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to use the Lightning port rather than the 30-pin port.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/grid-studio-iphone-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010397\" />\r<br/>\nGRID also makes art from other Apple products, like Apple Watches. The <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/apple-watch-series-0\">GRID Watch 1st Gen</a> is available for &#36;149, and it features Apple's first-ever Apple Watch. Components include the heart rate sensor, flex cable, display, main board, S1 chip, speaker, power button, battery, and Taptic Engine, along with the casing and band. It's a fun piece of Apple history for Apple Watch fans.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/grid-studio-apple-watch.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2528\" height=\"1422\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029294\" />\r<br/>\nWe have an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; to give away to one lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader.

Apple would continue to design iPhone chips, and Intel would start to handle a smaller percentage of manufacturing alongside Apple's primary chipmaker TSMC.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLast month, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he expects Intel to begin shipping Apple's lowest-end M-series chip for select Mac and iPad models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/28/intel-rumored-to-supply-new-mac-chip/\">as early as mid-2027</a>. For this, Kuo said Apple plans to utilize Intel's <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/process/18a.html\">18A process</a>, which is the \"earliest available sub-2nm advanced node manufactured in North America.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIntel supplying Apple-designed, Arm-based chips would differ from the era of Intel-based Macs, which used Intel-designed processors with x86 architecture.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple reaching a chip supply deal with Intel would boost its reliance on an American manufacturing company and help to diversify its supply chain.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIntel previously supplied Apple with cellular modems for some iPhone 7 to iPhone 11 models.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/intel/\">Intel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/05/intel-iphone-chips-rumor/\">Apple&#039;s Return to Intel Rumored to Extend to iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-return-to-intel-rumored-to-extend-to-iphone.2474269/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple is about to release iOS 26.2, the second major point update for iPhones since iOS 26 was rolled out in September, and there are at least 15 notable changes and improvements worth checking out. We've rounded them up below.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/iOS-26.2-Everything-New-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029010\" />\r<br/>\nApple is expected to roll out iOS 26.2 to compatible devices sometime between December 8 and December 16. When the update drops, you can check Apple's servers for the download by going to Settings ➝ General ➝ Software Update on your iPhone.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Set a Reminder Alarm</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/reminders-alarm-complete.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"5386\" height=\"3030\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027385\" />\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 brings a new alarm capability to the Reminders app. When you create a reminder, you can toggle on an \"Urgent\" option so that, at the due time, your iPhone sounds an alarm rather than simply showing a notification. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Adjust Liquid Glass Clock</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-liquid-glass-slider-extremes.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025677\" />\r<br/>\nApple's latest update adds a new slider under the \"Liquid Glass\" Lock Screen settings that gives much finer control over the clock's appearance. You can choose to make the time display nearly fully transparent, or more frosted and opaque, rather than being limited to the previous fixed presets. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>AirDrop Files to People Not in Contacts</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-airdrop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027227\" />\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 introduces a one-time AirDrop code system, letting you share files with someone even if they're not in your contacts. Once generated, the code remains valid for 30 days. Apple also includes a \"Manage Known AirDrop Contacts\" pane so that you can see and manage the people you've shared codes with.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>View Apple Music Lyrics Offline</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/Apple-Music-Lyrics.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026455\" />\r<br/>\nApple Music is gaining offline lyrics support, so you can now view song lyrics in the app even when your iPhone isn't connected to Wi-Fi or mobile data. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Get a Better Sleep Score</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/watchos-26-2-sleep-score.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025635\" />\r<br/>\nIf you wear your Apple Watch in bed, it's worth knowing that Apple has reworked its Sleep Score scoring tiers, with the aim of better matching typical sleep-quality experiences. Now, \"Very Low\" runs 0–40 (previously 0–29), \"Low\" 41–60, \"OK\" 61–80, \"High\" 81–95, and \"Very High\" 96–100 (previously labelled \"Excellent\"). \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Automatically Create Podcast Chapters</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/Apple-Podcasts-Chapters.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1300\" height=\"780\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026459\" />\r<br/>\nThe Podcasts app can now automatically generate chapters for individual episodes. This means that rather than fixed chapter markers, the app will create them for you – and episode transcriptions now let you tap on mentions of other podcasts or links. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Manage Websites Where Passwords Aren't Saved</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-passwords-excluded-websites.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"5541\" height=\"3117\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025696\" />\r<br/>\nIn the Passwords app's main settings menu, there's a new section allowing you to review and manage websites where you have deliberately avoided saving credentials. It gives you finer control over which domains are excluded from password storage.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Get AirPods Live Translation in EU</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/AirPods-Live-Translation.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025657\" />\r<br/>\nApple's latest update expands the reach of AirPods Live Translation to countries in the European Union. The feature was previously unavailable in the EU due to Apple's ongoing regulatory compliance work. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Flash iPhone Screen for Alerts</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-flash-alert.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025699\" />\r<br/>\nIn the Accessibility settings, under \"Flash for Alerts,\" you can now choose to have your iPhone screen flash when a notification arrives, rather than just the rear camera's LED flash. You can configure it to use the screen flash alone, the LED flash, or both simultaneously, giving you more flexibility for alert styles.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Quicker Access to Apple News Sections</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-apple-news-update.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025698\" />\r<br/>\nThe Apple News app gets a refreshed interface. The top-of-feed buttons now let you jump quickly into categories (e.g. sports, business, food, puzzles) instead of scrolling or tapping through menus.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Manage Safety Alerts</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-safety-alerts-enhanced.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025700\" />\r<br/>\niOS 26.2 introduces an \"Enhanced Safety Alerts\" section in Notifications settings that centralizes earthquake alerts, imminent-threat alerts, and also includes a new location-based \"improved alert delivery\" option, helping ensure the reliability of alerts. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Sort Games by Size</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-games-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026670\" />\r<br/>\nIn the Games app library, there's now an option to sort games by size (in addition to name or recent). It should prove useful if you want to clear storage or identify large games quickly.

      "content": "On this week's episode of <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/galaxy-z-trifold-vs-apples-foldable-iphone/id1602394741?i=1000739862319\">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss Samsung's new Galaxy Z TriFold smartphone and how it could compare to Apple's upcoming foldable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yl-itJiNYQM?si=174DmuY0NfdTFVJf\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div>\r<br/>\nSamsung this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-debut/\">introduced</a> the Galaxy Z TriFold, its first smartphone with two folding sections instead of one. When unfolded, the device presents a 10-inch screen, while the cover display measures 6.5 inches. Samsung says it has minimized visible creasing across the panels.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Galaxy Z TriFold uses an inward-folding design intended to protect the main display. The folding mechanism has been engineered with an alert system that notifies users if the device is being folded incorrectly. Samsung is using a titanium Armor FlexHinge with two differently sized hinges joined by a dual-rail structure. According to the company, this enables a smoother and more stable fold despite uneven panel weight distribution, and increases durability thanks to a thin metal reinforcement that protects the hinge assembly.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA third of the unfolded display measures 3.9mm thick, increasing slightly around the triple-lens camera module. The center display section is 4.2mm thick, while the segment containing the side button is 4mm. The device includes a reinforced overcoat atop a shock-absorbing display layer for impact resistance, and an aluminum frame prevents the screens from coming into contact when closed.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSamsung has equipped the Galaxy Z TriFold with a 5,600 mAh three-cell battery, with one cell behind each display panel. The company says this is the largest battery it has ever used in a smartphone. The rear camera system includes a 200-megapixel wide camera, a 12-megapixel ultra wide camera, and a 10-megapixel telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. Two 10-megapixel selfie cameras are integrated into the cover display and the main display.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Galaxy Z TriFold supports three portrait-layout apps running side-by-side, multi-window resizing, full-screen video viewing, and a vertical reading mode. Samsung has also added standalone Samsung DeX, enabling up to four workspaces with five apps active simultaneously. Samsung apps have been optimized for the triple-panel layout, and Google's Gemini Live has been optimized as well.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Galaxy Z TriFold launches in Korea on December 12, followed by China, Taiwan, Singapore, and the UAE. It will arrive in the United States in the first quarter of 2026. Pricing has not yet been announced.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMeanwhile, recent rumors suggest that Apple's first foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will feature an industry-first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/07/iphone-fold-24mp-under-display-camera/\">24-megapixel under-display camera</a> for the inner display, as well as a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/29/samsung-plan-to-make-foldable-displays/\">Samsung-supplied</a> OLED panel, virtually <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/24/iphone-fold-2026-engineering-validation/\">no crease</a>, a hybrid <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/08/foldable-iphone-titanium-aluminum-frame/\">titanium and aluminum frame</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/18/apple-foldable-biggest-iphone-battery/\">5,400–5,800 mAh battery</a>. Analyst estimates currently place pricing at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/24/foldable-iphone-could-cost-2400/\">around &#36;2,400</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe device is only expected to include two rear cameras, unlike the TriFold and all of Samsung's book-style foldables. Apple will likely use a wide and an ultra-wide camera, similar to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>, while reserving a telephoto camera for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/\">iPhone 18</a> Pro and Pro Max. Early information also suggests it will also not be as thin as Samsung's Galaxy Fold 7.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe discuss the importance of rear camera setups on foldables, the rumored price point of Apple's version, and the risk of it falling victim to some of the same pitfalls as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/\">iPhone Air</a>. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow\">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1\"><div class=\"fancybutton\">Subscribe to <em>The MacRumors Show</em> YouTube channel!</div></a></div>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYou can also listen to &zwnj;The MacRumors Show&zwnj;

      "content": "There is uncertainty about Apple's head of hardware engineering John Ternus succeeding <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> as CEO, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/silicon-valley-buzzing-apple-ceo-succession\"><em>The Information</em></a> reports. Some former Apple executives apparently hope that a new \"dark-horse\" candidate will emerge. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/Apple-John-Ternus-2019.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1027021\" />\r<br/>\nTernus is considered to be the most likely candidate to succeed Cook as CEO. The report notes that he is more likely to become CEO than software head chief Craig Federighi, Chief Operating Officer Sabih Khan, or marketing head Greg Joswiak.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTernus is 50 and has worked at Apple since 2001. He is known for being dependable and good at following orders with an obsessive attention to detail. Colleagues describe him as calm, emotionally intelligent, logical, and conservative. He purportedly took the fall for Apple's butterfly keyboard internally, which earned him respect. He also led the transition of the Mac to Apple silicon to much success. These situations are said to have helped Ternus earn Cook's trust. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHowever, some voices in the company believe that Ternus is not ready to take on the role, which could delay a succession announcement. Some skeptics inside the company say that Ternus is too risk averse, leading to frustrations within his group. For example, some in Apple's hardware engineering department were disappointed that Ternus declined to fund more ambitious projects.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOne of these individuals was vice president Tang Tan, who now leads OpenAI's project to build an AI hardware device designed by Apple's former chief designer, Jony Ive. Tan and Ive have since poached a large number of hardware engineers from Ternus' team to work on the unreleased device. Other critics say that Ternus \"isn't a charismatic leader\" and has had little involvement in the geopolitical affairs that have dominated the attention of Cook in recent years.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile Craig Federighi could succeed Cook due to his high profile, there are concerns that his focus on software may make him a poor fit for the role. He apparently prefers tackling technical problems rather than dealing with the kind of broader issues that the role of CEO demands.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFederighi is also risk-averse and voiced disproval over the Apple's spending on the Vision Pro and its now-canceled self-driving car project. He was also initially skeptical about AI, believing that the technology was overhyped and too unpredictable.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCook has said publicly that he wants Apple's next CEO to come from within the company, but it is possible that the company could opt for a former employee. One such individual is said to be former Apple hardware executive Tony Fadell, who co-created the iPod.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFadell reportedly told associates recently that he would be open to replacing Cook as CEO. Some former Apple executives believe that Fadell would help \"shake up\" the company from the perspective of a brash product leader.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOther individuals within Apple see the prospect as \"unlikely,\" since Fadell was a \"polarizing figure\" when he worked at the company. Apple passed on acquiring Fadell's smart home company Nest in 2014 because some staff did not want him to return to the company.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRegardless of who succeeds him, Cook is now thought to be highly likely to retire in the not-too-distant future. Some analysts believe that &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; \"hasn't moved fast enough\" or with the urgency of executives at Meta and Google to respond to the growing challenge of AI.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are reportedly growing signs in Cook's personal life that he could be planning to move on soon. He apparently no longer routinely rises at 4 a.m. as he once did to go to the gym. Individuals around Cook have begun to notice a slight tremor in his hands, which was also visible during a recent visit to the White House.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn addition, Cook surprised colleagues when he purchased a luxury home outside Palm Springs, California. The report notes that he used to be noticeably more frugal, such as when he chose to rent a home in Silicon Valley rather than buying one to save money.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSenior Apple employees are said to be so sure of the likelihood of major management changes at the company, which could open up new opportunities, that they have raised the situation to many who have tried to recruit them. <div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/craig-federighi/\">Craig Federighi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/john-ternus/\">John Ternus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/\">The Information</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tony-fadell/\">Tony Fadell</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/05/will-john-ternus-be-next-apple-ceo/\">Will John Ternus Really Be Apple&#039;s Next CEO?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-john-ternus-really-be-apples-next-ceo.2474265/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

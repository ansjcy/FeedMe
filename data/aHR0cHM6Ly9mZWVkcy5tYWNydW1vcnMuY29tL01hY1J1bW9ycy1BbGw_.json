The breakdown shows iOS 26.1 accounting for approximately 10.6% of devices, iOS 26.2 for about 4.6%, and the original iOS 26.0 release at roughly 1.1%. In contrast, more than 60% of iPhones tracked by StatCounter remain on iOS 18, with iOS 18.7 and iOS 18.6 alone representing a majority of active devices.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHistorical comparisons highlight how atypical this adoption curve appears. StatCounter data from January 2025 shows that roughly 63% of iPhones were running some version of iOS 18 about four months after its release. In January 2024, iOS 17 had reached approximately 54% adoption over a similar timeframe, while iOS 16 surpassed 60% adoption by January 2023.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBased on those figures, &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; adoption appears to be running at less than one-quarter of the rate achieved by recent predecessors during the same post-release window. StatCounter derives its estimates from web traffic analytics, tracking operating system versions via page impressions across its global network of participating websites. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn the first week of January last year, 89.3% of <em>MacRumors</em> visitors used a version of iOS 18. This year, during the same time period, only 25.7% of <em>MacRumors</em> readers are running a version of &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. In the absence of official numbers from Apple, the true adoption rate remains unknown, but the data suggests a level of hesitation toward &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; that has not been seen in recent years. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUnlike many previous releases, &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; introduces Liquid Glass as a fundamental visual overhaul, replacing large portions of the traditional opaque interface with translucent layers, blurred backgrounds, and dynamic depth effects across system elements. Upon its announcement at WWDC last year, the redesign received mixed reviews, which could be a contributing factor to hesitation around upgrading.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLikewise, Apple now continues to support older operating systems with security updates, allowing users to remain on iOS 18 without immediate pressure to update or forfeit critical patches. This makes it much easier for users to remain on older software.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/08/ios-26-shows-unusually-slow-adoption/\">iOS 26 Shows Unusually Slow Adoption Months After Release</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-shows-unusually-slow-adoption-months-after-release.2475786/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

A control number included in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials that's provided to shareholders is required to join.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAt the meeting, shareholders will vote to re-elect the company's board of directors, approve executive compensation, and ratify Ernst & Young LLP as Apple's public accounting firm. There will also be votes on shareholder proposals.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNotably, both board chairman Art Levinson (age 75) and board member Ron Sugar (age 77) are up for re-election, despite a company guideline stating that directors may generally not stand for re-election once they have reached the age of 75. Apple provided the following justification in its proxy statement:<blockquote>Over the past four years, the Board has added three new members, representing over one-third of its membership, and two other, long-serving members retired. In the context of this year’s Annual Meeting nominations, the Board determined that it would be in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders to ask Art Levinson, the Chair of the Board, and Ron Sugar, the Chair of the Audit Committee, to stand for re-election, and to waive for each of them its guideline under which directors generally may not stand for re-election after attaining age 75. In making this determination, the Board considered several factors, including the significant experience and expertise that each of Dr. Levinson and Dr. Sugar brings to the Board, their deep insight into the Company’s business and operations, and their individual contributions as highly engaged members of the Board. The Board also considered the benefits of continuity among the Board’s leadership positions.</blockquote>Levinson's re-nomination as chairman is notable due to recent speculation around <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a>'s potential retirement as Apple CEO, a move that would likely see him shift into the board chairman position. It is possible that Levinson's continuation in the role beyond age 75 is intended to also serve as bridge to such time that Cook is ready to assume the chairman role, rather than selecting a new chairman for only a relatively brief time until Cook steps down as CEO.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/08/apple-shareholders-meeting-2026/\">Apple&#039;s Annual Shareholders Meeting Will Take Place on February 24</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-annual-shareholders-meeting-will-take-place-on-february-24.2475780/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

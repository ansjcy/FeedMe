      "content": "Though it's been just a few months since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a> launched, we're already hearing rumors about the next-generation version of iOS, iOS 27. iOS 27 will be introduced at Apple's June WWDC 2026 event before it launches in September 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028322\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/iOS-27-Mock-Quick.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br/>\nWe don't know all of the details about iOS 27 yet, but we do have some information about what to expect.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>\"Snow Leopard\" Update</h2>\r<br/>\niOS 27 will apparently focus on bug fixes and under-the-hood improvements to boost performance rather than new features. It's been referred to as a \"Snow Leopard\" update, because that was a version of macOS that Apple famously claimed had \"zero new features\" because it was all about fixing the existing software.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple engineers are reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/23/ios-27-two-key-upgrades/\">going through iOS 26</a> to look for bloat, bugs, and any other issues impacting performance that can be fixed in iOS 27.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"foldable_features\">iPhone Fold</h2>\r<br/>\nIn 2026, Apple plans to launch the first foldable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, a device rumors have taken to calling the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold is expected to have a ~5.4-inch display when folded, and a ~7.7-inch display when it's opened up like a book. It will be shorter and wider than other foldables on the market, with a 4:3 aspect ratio. At around 5.4 inches when closed, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold's outer display will be the smallest we've had since the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 mini.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith Apple going back to a smaller display and simultaneously introducing a 7.7-inch display that's larger than any &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; display to date, we're going to need some updates to iOS. iOS 27 will focus on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/21/ios-27-prioritize-foldable-iphone-features/\">introducing new interfaces</a> and experiences for a larger display and a display that shifts between multiple sizes.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe haven't heard specifics on how Apple will tweak iOS to accommodate the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold, but we could see some iPad-like options such as side bars and perhaps even multitasking views with support for multiple windows.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"liquid_glass\">Liquid Glass</h2>\r<br/>\niOS 27 will likely include refinements for the Liquid Glass design that Apple introduced with &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. There have already been some changes in the iOS 26.1 and iOS 26.2 updates, but iOS 27 will provide Apple with the opportunity to make larger adjustments to respond to customer feedback.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"apple_intelligence\">Apple Intelligence</h2>\r<br/>\nWe're supposed to get the much smarter version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> in an iOS 26.4 update planned for spring 2026, but it's likely even more <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> capabilities will follow in iOS 27.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe don't know specifics yet, but several existing &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features could expand to additional apps.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is also working on a \"World Knowledge\" <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/03/llm-siri-with-search-early-2026/\">Siri search feature</a> that would provide information on general search queries, which will likely be included in &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s iOS 26.4 update. If it's not in iOS 26.4, the add-on &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; feature could instead come in iOS 27.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"siri\">Siri</h2>\r<br/>\nWith iOS 27, Apple could <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/siri-redesign-report/\">update Siri's design</a>. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will get its major overhaul in iOS 26.4, but a new visual look is supposedly planned for iOS 27. There are no specifics about what the redesign might entail, but rumors linked to Apple's upcoming tabletop robot suggest that the company <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-launching-robot-virtual-companion-in-2027/\">might introduce</a> a version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that's more animated, similar to the Mac Finder logo. That more animated version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; could also come to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and we could see it first in iOS 27.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"health+\">Health+</h2>\r<br/>\nApple is developing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/24/apple-health-plus-rumored-to-launch-next-year/\">a paid Health+ service</a> with nutrition planning and medical suggestions, and we could see that introduced as part of iOS 27.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe medical tool would explain different health metrics and trends from the Health app, offering up personalized guidance for health improvement.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"new_satellite_features\">New Satellite Features</h2>\r<br/>\nApple is working on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/09/apple-developing-new-satellite-features/\">several new satellite features</a> for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and it's possible some features could be introduced as soon as iOS 27. Timing on Apple's satellite improvements is unclear, though, and behind-the-scenes updates from Apple's satellite partner Globalstar are required.\r<br/>\nRumored features:\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a> via satellite</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> in Messages via satellite</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Satellite API framework for third-party apps</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Satellite over 5G</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Satellite connectivity without the need for a view of the sky</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nSome of these features might require new hardware, but options like &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; via satellite would not require components beyond what's available now.\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"launch_date\">Launch Date</h2>\r<br/>\nNew versions of iOS, macOS, and Apple's other software platforms will be previewed in June at WWDC before launching in September just ahead of when new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models come out.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-27/\">iOS 27</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/07/five-iphone-features-rumored-ios-27/\">Five New iPhone Features Rumored for iOS 27</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/five-new-iphone-features-rumored-for-ios-27.2475734/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "The Xthings Ultraloq Bolt Sense is a smart lock that incorporates biometric authentication and Matter support. The Bolt Sense is able to identify a person through 3D facial recognition and palm vein authentication.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/bolt-sense-lock.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"674\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031539\" />\r<br/>\nXthings says the dual biometric approach is meant to be more secure than traditional biometric unlocking methods, but it may also exist because few companies have managed to master facial recognition as accurate as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a>. The extra palm scan, which identifies an individual's sub-surface vein pattern, ensures that facial recognition won't fail. With biometric unlocking, users can open the door hands-free, and the palm scan works even when the hands are wet.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Bolt Sense combines biometric unlocking with active approach sensing, advanced infrared, and adaptive low-light performance, so it works in the daytime and at night.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nXthings isn't launching the Ultraloq Bolt Sense until the second quarter of 2026, but the <a href=\"https://ultraloq.com/products/bolt-mission\">Ultraloq Bolt Mission</a>, a Matter-enabled smart lock with Ultra Wideband, is available for purchase as of today. The &#36;300 Bolt Mission uses UWB for automatic hands-free unlocking as the homeowner approaches.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt also supports unlocking via the Apple Home app, NFC, the Ultraloq app, a PIN, a physical key, or the Apple Watch. It does not support Apple Home Key, and the UWB only works with the Ultraloq app. The Bolt Mission uses 8 AA batteries that need to be replaced every six months, or users can purchase a rechargeable lithium battery pack that lasts for up to 1.5 years before it needs to be charged.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlong with the two Bolt locks, Xthings also debuted the Latch 7 Pro, a latch-style smart lock that will support Matter over Thread and Aliro, a universal smart lock standard that Apple is involved in.

Barring any \"last minute hiccups,\" the deal should be announced shortly after over a year of negotiations.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Apple-Card-iPhone-16-Pro-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2049\" height=\"1153\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-985779\" />\r<br/>\nReports began circulating <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/30/goldman-sachs-apple-partnership-amex/\">over two years ago</a> that current Apple Card issuer Goldman Sachs was looking to end its partnership with Apple as part of an effort to scale back on consumer banking products amid steep losses.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAccording to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, Goldman Sachs is unloading its roughly &#36;20 billion of outstanding Apple Card balances at a discount of more than &#36;1 billion, a rare move for co-branded account deals like this. But higher-than-average delinquency rates and high exposure to subprime borrowers made it more difficult for Goldman Sachs to find a buyer.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nJPMorgan Chase's interest in taking over as Apple Card issuer was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/17/jpmorgan-chase-apple-card-talks/\">reported over a year ago</a>, and by this past summer Chase <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/29/apple-card-jpmorgan-chase-report/\">appeared to be the front-runner</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlongside its new Apple Card partnership, JPMorgan Chase will reportedly launch a new Apple savings account, but existing users with Apple savings accounts at Goldman Sachs will not be automatically transitioned and will need to decide whether they want to stay at Goldman Sachs or open new accounts with Chase.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>Update 2:27 pm</b>: Apple has <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/chase-to-become-new-issuer-of-apple-card/\">officially announced the change to Chase</a>, with the transition expected to occur in approximately 24 months.

      "content": "OpenAI today <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-health/\">announced the launch of ChatGPT Health</a>, a dedicated section of ChatGPT where users can ask health-related questions completely separated from their main ChatGPT experience.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/ChatGPT-Health-Integration-Connectors-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028892\" />\r<br/>\nFor more personalized responses, users can connect various health data services such as Apple Health, Function, MyFitnessPal, Weight Watchers, AllTrails, Instacart, and Peloton. Last month, <em>MacRumors</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/02/chatgpt-apple-health-connector/\">discovered icons related to Apple Health within the ChatGPT app</a>, and today's announcement makes the integration official. Once connected, ChatGPT will be able to access your health and fitness data from Apple Health, including movement, sleep, and activity patterns.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nChatGPT Health can also integrate with your medical records, allowing ChatGPT Health to analyze your lab results and other aspects of your medical history to inform its answers to your health-related questions. OpenAI emphasizes that ChatGPT Health is not intended to provide diagnoses or treatment and is not a substitute for consulting with medical professionals, but it can be used to help understand results or prepare for upcoming appointments.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPrivacy and security are always major concerns when it comes to health records, and OpenAI says ChatGPT Health has been developed with multiple layers of encryption and operates as a separate space with enhanced privacy. Data from ChatGPT Health is not used to train ChatGPT's foundation models by default, and users who start health-related conversations in the general ChatGPT interface will receive suggestions to move the discussions to the Health section.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nChatGPT Health is launching with a <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/health/waitlist\">waitlist</a> to join a group of beta users, with users on ChatGPT Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans outside of the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom eligible to start. Medical record integrations and some apps are only available in the United States at the current time. Access to ChatGPT Health will expand to all users on web and iOS in the coming weeks.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-health/\">Apple Health</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/\">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/07/openai-chatgpt-health-apple-health-integration/\">OpenAI Launches ChatGPT Health With Apple Health Integration</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/openai-launches-chatgpt-health-with-apple-health-integration.2475721/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

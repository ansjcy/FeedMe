It seems to be identical to Apple's existing hardware, but uses a dark finish not seen on any production Vision Pro hardware. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nKosutami <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-vision-air-rumored-with-new-design/\">previously claimed</a> that Apple has been testing a thinner and lighter mixed-reality headset referred to internally as \"Vision Air,\" featuring a Midnight-colored exterior and reduced weight achieved by switching several structural components and the battery enclosure to titanium. According to the leaker, this model would retain an aluminum exterior but adopt a deep bluish-black finish rather than the Vision Pro's current silver and white.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEarlier this year, Kosutami also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/17/images-of-apple-vision-air-cable/\">shared images</a> of a new Lightning-style connector in Midnight said to be intended for a next-generation Vision headset. The existing Vision Pro uses a 12-pin connector, while the unreleased cable featured only eight pins, which seemed to indicate that Apple may have been redesigning the external battery system for future headsets.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple had been widely expected to release a lower-cost headset called the \"Vision Air,\" as well as a redesigned second-generation Vision Pro. However, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported in October that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/01/apple-ai-smart-glasses-focus/\">paused development of all Vision headsets</a> in order to accelerate work on AI-powered smart glasses.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/\">Kosutami</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/07/more-black-vision-pro-parts-surface-online/\">More All-Black Vision Pro Prototype Parts Surface Online</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/more-all-black-vision-pro-prototype-parts-surface-online.2474341/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) argues that location data from cell tower triangulation is not sufficiently precise for investigative use and that authorities should have access to meter-level coordinates provided by GPS.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGPS is typically activated only when specific apps request location access or when an emergency call is placed. The COAI has also asked the government to require smartphone makers to disable pop-up notifications that inform users when a carrier is attempting to access location information.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple has formally opposed the proposal. In a letter sent in July by the India Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA), which represents Apple and Google, the companies warned the government that forcing GPS to remain active at all times would constitute a regulatory overreach. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe news comes shortly after India reversed a separate directive that would have required all smartphone makers, including Apple, to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/02/apple-resists-india-order-state-app-iphones/\">preinstall a government app</a> and prevent users from disabling its functions.

      "content": "Apple's senior vice president of hardware technologies Johny Srouji could be the next leading executive to leave the company amid an alarming exodus of leading employees, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-06/apple-rocked-by-executive-departures-with-johny-srouji-at-risk-of-leaving-next\">Mark Gurman reports</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/Johny-Srouji.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-843011\" />\r<br/>\nSrouji apparently recently told CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> that he is \"seriously considering leaving\" in the near future. He intends to join another company if he departs. Srouji leads Apple's chip design and pioneered the transition to Apple silicon.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEarlier this week, it emerged that Meta had hired multiple significant Apple employees, including longtime Apple designer <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/apple-alan-dye-joining-meta/\">Alan Dye</a>, while conducting its own recruiting blitz for AI and smart glasses development. Meanwhile, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/04/two-more-apple-executives-retiring/\">announced the retirement</a> of Senior Vice President and General Counsel Kate Adams, Lisa Jackson, Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/apple-ai-chief-retiring-after-siri-failure/\">AI chief John Giannandrea</a>. Earlier this year, Apple lost Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/08/jeff-williams-stepping-down-as-apple-coo/\">who is retiring</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-cfo-luca-maestri-stepping-down/\">Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri</a>. There have also been rumors about Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; retiring, with rumors suggesting he is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/15/report-tim-cook-to-step-down-as-soon-as-next-year/\">preparing to leave his role</a> as soon as next year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGurman says that the losses are partly due to veteran executives nearing retirement age, but there is still a \"disconcerting brain drain\" taking place in the company. Nevertheless, Gurman says the accumulative weight of the departures all adds up to \"one of the most tumultuous stretches of Cooks tenure.\" Some of the losses are said to be a \"cause for deep concern,\" and Cook is now looking to prevent further loss of leading talent with stronger compensation packages.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGurman notes that \"Apple hasn't launched a successful new product category in a decade,\" leaving it increasingly vulnerable to having its talent poached by more agile rivals who are said to be better equipped to develop the next generation of devices and AI technologies. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCook himself is thought to be likely to join the exodus and step down in the not-too-distant future. He turned 65 last month and now exhibits a noticeable, unexplained tremor in his hands. He is likely to transition to the role of chairman, rather than vacate the company entirely.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe departure of Srouji is said to be \"a more imminent risk\" and Cook is purportedly working hard to retain him by offering a substantial pay package and the potential of more responsibility. Some executives have suggested elevating Srouji to the role of chief technology officer. This would move him to oversee a broad range of hardware engineering and silicon technologies, making him Apple's second-most powerful executive. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGurman says this change would likely require John Ternus to be promoted to CEO, but Srouji apparently would prefer to not work under a different CEO, even with an expanded remit. If he does leave, Srouji would likely be replaced by Zongjian Chen or Sribalan Santhanam. Beyond Srouji and the other reported departures, Apple is believed to be contending with a significant talent drain among its key engineers. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGurman explains that there has been \"a broader collapse within Apple's artificial intelligence organization\" triggered by AI models chief Ruoming Pang departing earlier this year, along with colleagues such as Tom Gunter and Frank Chu. Apple lost <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> and search overseer Robby Walker, as well as his replacement, Ke Yang, to Meta.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's AI group is apparently suffering from low morale and there is growing worry over the increasing use of external AI technology such as Google Gemini. Around a dozen of Apple's leading AI researchers have also now departed. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe company's AI robotics software team has seen widespread departures, including its leader Jian Zhang, who joined Meta. The user interface team has also lost members, such as Billy Sorrentino, culminating in Dye's exit. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's hardware design group \"has been nearly wiped out,\" with many employees vacating to other companies or following former design chief Jony Ive to his studio, LoveFrom. Abidur Chowdhury, the designer behind the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/\">iPhone Air</a> who narrated its unveiling in September, left for an AI startup.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe company has lost a key director in charge of display technologies, Cheng Chen, to OpenAI. He also oversaw the optics of the Vision Pro headset. In addition, one of Apple’s top hardware engineering executives, Tang Tan, similarly left for OpenAI.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple has even lost the dean of Apple University, Richard Locke. Apple University is the internal program intended to preserve the company's practices and culture following the death of Steve Jobs.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe exodus has become a major concern for Apple's leadership, which has instructed human resources to ramp up recruitment and retention efforts.

Apple this week seeded release candidate versions of the updates to developers and public beta testers, suggesting an official release for everyone will come next week.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/iOS-26.2-Whats-New-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027938\" />\r<br/>\nThe imminent iOS 26.2 update arrives as Apple has started to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/02/apple-pushes-ios-18-users-to-ios-26/\">more aggressively push users still on iOS 18 to upgrade to iOS 26</a>. Since ‌iOS 26‌ launched in September, it has been displayed as an optional upgrade at the bottom of the Software Update interface in the Settings app, with iOS 18 updates displayed more prominently.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nStarting this week, that's changed. iOS 18 users who have not upgraded to ‌iOS 26 now see iOS 26.1 (and soon iOS 26.2) as the recommended iOS update in the Settings app. iOS 18 updates are still an option, but are now displayed at the bottom of the app.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple UI Design Chief Alan Dye Leaving for Meta</h3>\r<br/>\nIn a move that came as a surprise to most observers, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/apple-alan-dye-joining-meta/\">Apple design chief Alan Dye has decided to leave the company</a> after 19 years and take a role as chief design officer at Meta.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/Photos-App-Icon-Liquid-Glass.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005747\" />\r<br/>\nDye oversaw the major Liquid Glass design update that debuted this year, which has not arrived without controversy, and some both inside and outside of Apple are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/04/john-gruber-on-alan-dye/\">not exactly sorry to see Dye go</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDye's departure follows closely on the heels of Apple announcing that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/apple-ai-chief-retiring-after-siri-failure/\">AI chief John Giannandrea has stepped down from his position</a> and will serve as an advisor until he retires early next year. Giannandrea has been under pressure as Apple has fallen behind in the race to develop and deploy AI capabilities, and some of his responsibilities had already been shifted to other executives.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs if that wasn't enough, Apple also announced this week that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/04/two-more-apple-executives-retiring/\">general counsel Kate Adams and environment chief Lisa Jackson will both be retiring in 2026</a>, with the company working to transition their responsibilities to other executives.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple and Intel Rumored to Partner on Mac and iPhone Chips in a New Way</h3>\r<br/>\nWhile all Macs are now powered by Apple's custom-designed chips, a new rumor claims that Apple may rekindle its partnership with Intel, albeit in a new and limited way.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/New-Intel-Logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028509\" />\r<br/>\nApple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo this week said <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/28/intel-rumored-to-supply-new-mac-chip/\">Intel is expected to begin shipping Apple's lowest-end M-series chip as early as mid-2027</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf this rumor proves accurate, Intel could supply Apple with M6 or M7 chips for future MacBook Air, iPad Air, and iPad Pro models at a minimum. However, while previous Intel chips for Macs were designed by Intel and based on x86 architecture, M-series chips are designed by Apple and use Arm architecture. Intel would only assist with manufacturing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/05/intel-iphone-chips-rumor/\">partnership may also extend to the iPhone</a> with Intel producing future chips for non-pro iPhone models starting in 2028, which could perhaps mean the A22 chip for devices like the iPhone 20 and iPhone 20e.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>iPhone Fold: Launch, Pricing, and What to Expect From Apple's Foldable</h3>\r<br/>\nApple is expected to launch a new foldable iPhone next year, based on multiple rumors and credible sources. The long-awaited device has been rumored for years now, but signs increasingly suggest that 2026 could indeed be the year that Apple releases its first foldable device.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/iphone-fold-text.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029302\" />\r<br/>\nAs rumors continue to surface, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/iphone-fold-foldable-launch-pricing-what-to-expect/\">we've collated an updated set of key details</a> that have been leaked about Apple's foldable iPhone so far. Apple will allegedly call the device the \"‌iPhone‌ Fold,\" which is the name the media has already adopted when sharing rumors about the product.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Music Replay 2025 Now Fully Available</h3>\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/02/apple-music-replay-2025-fully-available/\">full Replay 2025 experience is now available in the Apple Music app</a>, allowing you to reflect on your listening habits over the past year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/Apple-Music-Replay-2025-Full.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"897\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028842\" />\r<br/>\nThere are two main components of the Replay 2025 experience. First, there is a full year-end playlist containing the Apple Music songs that you listened to the most over the past year, and second, there is a Highlight Reel with images and a video that are designed to be shared on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>iPhone 17 Demand Is Breaking Apple's Sales Records</h3>\r<br/>\nApple's iPhone 17 lineup is selling well enough that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/02/apple-2025-iphone-sales-record/\">Apple is on track to ship more than 247.4 million total iPhones in 2025</a>, according to a new report from IDC.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/iphone-17-pros-dan-hands-on.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022058\" />\r<br/>\nTotal 2025 shipments are forecast to grow 6.1 percent year over year due to ‌iPhone 17‌ demand and increased sales in China, a major market for Apple.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOverall worldwide smartphone shipments across Android and iOS are forecast to grow 1.5 percent, primarily because of the success of the iPhone.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>MacRumors Newsletter</h2>\r<br/>\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/dec-4-2025\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/06/top-stories-ios-26-2-coming-soon/\">Top Stories: iOS 26.2 Coming Soon, Apple Execs Depart, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-ios-26-2-coming-soon-apple-execs-depart-and-more.2474294/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

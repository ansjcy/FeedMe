      "content": "Apple's Beats brand is launching a new celebrity ad campaign today featuring rapper Travis Scott and entitled \"DARE TO DREAM.\" The campaign is inspired by a 2011 tweet from Scott when he was just starting his career, in which he claimed, \"One day Travis Scott will be somebody.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHYXwUkpGh0?si=4OAQcWIXgYpvo_aI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r<br/>\nThe campaign short film is a \"testament to how belief in oneself can manifest into reality\" and features a re-creation of his actual childhood bedroom and an appearance by his real mother, Wanda Webster.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe film depicts a young Scott working on music projects using his <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> and the original Beats Studio headphones, with the scene transforming from his bedroom to a dream of sold-out shows on his just-completed \"Circus Maximus\" tour spanning multiple legs over the past two years.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/beats-travis-scott-be-somebody.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030718\" />\r<br/>\nThe dream is short-lived, however, with his mother calling him back to reality and sending him off to school. Inspired by the dream, Scott composes his prophetic tweet, and on his way out of the house he discovers a pair of Powerbeats Fit in his pocket, a symbol linking past and present.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile the partnership with Scott is currently focused on the campaign film, Beats Chief Marketing Officer Chris Thorne hints that we can expect to see more in the future.<blockquote>“This campaign captures something deeply personal — the belief that greatness starts with a single idea and the courage to chase it,” said Chris Thorne, Beats CMO. “It’s the same belief that connects Beats and Travis — and this is only the beginning of what we’ll build together.”</blockquote>Whether this means we'll see any product partnerships between Beats and Scott down the road remains to be seen.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/travis-scott/\">Travis Scott</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/19/beats-travis-scott-campaign/\">Beats Launches Travis Scott Partnership Featuring New &#039;DARE TO DREAM&#039; Ad Campaign</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beats-launches-travis-scott-partnership-featuring-new-dare-to-dream-ad-campaign.2474992/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Since the beginning of December, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/02/apple-pushes-ios-18-users-to-ios-26/\">has been pushing</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users who opted to stay on iOS 18 to install <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a> instead. Apple started by making the iOS 18 upgrades less visible, and has now transitioned to making new iOS 18 updates unavailable on any device capable of running &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/ios-18-security-update.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030704\" />\r<br/>\nIf you have an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 or later, Apple is no longer offering new versions of iOS 18, even though there was a security update that came out alongside iOS 26.2. Apple stopped showing new iOS 18 updates <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/12/apple-releases-ios-26-2/\">when iOS 26.2 launched</a>, forcing iOS 18 users to upgrade to iOS 26.2 if they want to keep their devices secure.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor now, there's a way to stay on iOS 18 and continue to get security updates. On a device running iOS 18, you can turn on iOS 18 public beta updates to force new versions of iOS 18 to show up. This may not remain an option for long, but it works at the current time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's move to push users to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; is timed with a long list of security updates introduced in iOS 26.2 and iOS 18.7.3, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/12/ios-26-2-security-vulnerabilities/\">a WebKit vulnerability</a> known to be actively exploited. Both updates addressed the problem, so there is no technical need for the iOS 26.2 requirement.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nJason Snell <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/12/apple-is-forcing-iphones-to-update-to-ios-26-to-patch-security-holes/\">wrote an article yesterday</a> on Apple's decision not to offer iOS 18 users further iOS 18 upgrades and speculated that it might be a bug or an error, but the reality is that Apple does this every year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-wont-make-you-upgrade-to-ios-15/\">iOS 14 to iOS 15 transition</a> in 2021 was the first time that Apple allowed users to remain on an older version of iOS. At the time, Apple said that iOS offered \"a choice between two software update versions.\" Users would be able to update to iOS 15 at release, or opt to continue on iOS 14 and \"still get important security updates.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs promised, Apple <em>did</em> allow users to stay on iOS 14 and avoid the iOS 15 update, but only temporarily. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/13/apple-pushing-ios-14-users-upgrade-ios-15/\">started pushing people</a> to iOS 15 in January 2022 by making the iOS 15 software update option more prominent and no longer offering iOS 14 security updates for devices capable of running iOS 15.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn fact, iOS 14 updates stopped being available when Apple launched iOS 15.2, which might sound familiar because it is the exact same path that it followed with the iOS 18 to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; transition. Apple did the same thing with the iOS 16 to iOS 17 transition, and the iOS 17 to iOS 18 transition.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor a clear answer why iOS 18 security updates are no longer available on devices capable of running &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, we can <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/19/ios-14-option-temporary-apple/\">look to what Apple had to say</a> in 2022 after people complained about being forced to upgrade to iOS 15. According to Apple, the option for users to stay on iOS 14 and avoid iOS 15 was always meant to be temporary. Apple provided a grace period for people to remain on iOS 14 while iOS 15 bugs were worked out, but Apple ultimately wanted users on the latest version of iOS.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn a support document published in 2021, Apple clarified that users would be able to stay on the old version of iOS \"for a period of time,\" but not forever.\r<br/>\n<blockquote>If you're using iOS or iPadOS 14.5 or later, you might now see the option to choose between two software update versions. This option allows you to choose between updating to the latest version of iOS or iPadOS 15 as soon as it's released, or continuing on iOS or iPadOS 14 while still getting important security updates for a period of time.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nApple has continued with the same update policy since iOS 15, but the company's move to wean users off of iOS 18 is more visible this year due to the design changes introduced with &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. Liquid Glass is a major user interface overhaul that's polarizing, and some users are unsurprisingly reluctant to update for that reason.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>Update:</b> Apple is no longer allowing the iOS 18 public beta to be used to skirt the iOS 18 to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; transition. Opting in to the iOS 18 beta no longer triggers the iOS 18.7.3 update. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/19/ios-18-forced-ios-26-upgrade/\">Don&#039;t Want to Upgrade to iOS 26?

The technology that Astropad is using cuts reflections by 75 percent, while improving contrast and keeping colors vibrant. Unlike other anti-reflective screen protectors, there's no haze or distortion.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-comparison-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030688\" />\r<br/>\nPriced at &#36;30, Fresh Coat is made from a scratch-proof tempered glass that also provides protection for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display in addition to cutting down on glare and reflections. It's slim and won't add any bulk to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; even though it has a five-layer design. From the top down, there's an anti-reflective coating, an oleophobic and hydrophobic coating, a layer of tempered glass, a dust barrier, and an impact-resistant \"airbag\" bonding.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-layers.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030684\" />\r<br/>\nIf you have an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, it comes with a new anti-reflective coating added by Apple. What you might not know, though, is that you can't use just any screen protector with the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;. If you put a regular screen protector without an anti-reflective coating on, it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/04/iphone-17-screen-protector-anti-reflective-issue/\">entirely nullifies</a> the anti-reflective properties of that added coating.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-comparison-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030685\" />\r<br/>\nSince Fresh Coat has its own anti-reflective coating, it actually improves upon Apple's included anti-reflective layer, reducing glare even further. With Fresh Coat, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s screen is easy to see in any lighting conditions, there's less eye strain, and if you use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/\">Dark Mode</a>, it looks even darker.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-description.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030686\" />\r<br/>\nIf you don't have an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, Fresh Coat can provide an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17-style display upgrade, mirroring Apple's own reflection-reducing display coating.

It offers the A18 chip and a 48-megapixel camera in an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13-style design, but with matte back glass, a USB-C port, and no <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>. The device debuted Apple's custom C1 5G modem, replacing components from Qualcomm for the first time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn March, Apple refreshed several iPads and Macs. The standard <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> was updated with the A16 chip, and noticeably still lacks <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> support. The 11- and 13-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> was refreshed with the M3 chip, and Apple released a redesigned Magic Keyboard for it. Apple also updated the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> with the M4 chip and introduced a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a> with M4 Max and M3 Ultra chip options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAt WWDC in June, Apple previewed its major software updates for the year. The biggest announcement was the introduction of Liquid Glass, an all-new design language for all of Apple's software platforms.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a> redesigned apps such as Phone and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a>, and added Live Translation with AirPods, a host of new features for Messages, and a new Games app. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a> introduced a new, Mac-like multitasking system with windows, while macOS 26 Tahoe revamped Spotlight with a clipboard history feature and quick commands.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn September, Apple released its annual &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup update. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> features a larger display with ProMotion for refresh rates up to 120Hz and a 48-megapixel Fusion ultra-wide camera.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max tout a completely new aluminum unibody frame with a large, full-width camera plateau and vapor chamber cooling. The telephoto camera received a major upgrade to 48-megapixels, with options for 4x and 8x optical zoom.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/\">iPhone Air</a> arrived as a totally new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; option, replacing the \"Plus\" model in the lineup. Sitting between the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; has a radically thin design with a polished titanium frame, and uses Apple's custom C1X and N1 connectivity chips. The device only has one rear camera, a single speaker, and supports eSIM only.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAll of the new iPhones feature an A19 or A19 Pro chip, Ceramic Shield 2, a 18-megapixel Center Stage front-facing camera with a square sensor, and new color options. Apple also released updated charging and accessory products, including a new &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; battery designed specifically for the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;, TechWoven cases, and crossbody straps.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple refreshed its wearable and audio lineups in the same month. Apple Watch SE was updated with the S10 chip and an always-on display. The aluminum Apple Watch Series 11 gained stronger front glass and a slightly bigger battery, while the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 3</a> gains satellite connectivity for the first time. Cellular models of the new Apple Watches feature 5G connectivity.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple also released the third generation of AirPods Pro, with improved active noise cancellation, a more refined design with ear tips that include foam, and heart-rate sensing. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn October, Apple updated the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, 14-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>, and Vision Pro with the M5 chip. The new Vision Pro also gained a new dual knit headband, promising improved comfort, along with better battery life, higher-refresh rate displays, more rendered pixels.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow\">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips in 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1\"><div class=\"fancybutton\">Subscribe to <em>The MacRumors Show</em> YouTube channel!</div></a></div>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYou can also listen to &zwnj;The MacRumors Show&zwnj;

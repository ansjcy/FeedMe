      "content": "As OpenAI is making plans to introduce ads to ChatGPT, competitor Anthropic has promised to <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think\">keep Claude ad-free</a>. In a blog post today, the company said that there are \"many good places for advertising,\" but a \"conversation with Claude is not one of them.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/anthopic-claude.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1782\" height=\"1002\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1021456\" />\r<br/>\nAccording to Anthropic, including ads in Claude would not be in line with its mission of creating a helpful assistant for work and deep thinking. Anthropic claims that users should not need to second-guess whether an AI is being helpful or \"subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere will be no ads or sponsored links in conversations with Claude, and Claude's responses will not be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements.\r<br/>\n<blockquote>Our analysis of conversations with Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data private and anonymous) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal--the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous--and, in many cases, inappropriate.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nPromising an ad-free experience could encourage people to choose Claude over OpenAI's ChatGPT. In January, OpenAI said that it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/16/chatgpt-go-now-available-worldwide/\">would start testing ads</a> in the United States for free and Go tier subscribers, though subscribers with higher paid tiers will not see ads. OpenAI claims that ads will be clearly labeled and will not influence the answers that ChatGPT provides, nor will the company provide conversation details to advertisers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTo further reinforce the difference between Claude's ad-free experience and ChatGPT's ad-supported experience, Anthropic plans to run a humorous Super Bowl commercial where a man gets an unwanted cougar dating ad after asking about his mother. \"Ads are coming to AI,\" reads the video's text. \"But not to Claude.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe title=\"How can I communicate better with my mom?\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FBSam25u8O4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r<br/>\nAnthropic plans to continue to monetize through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, with revenue reinvested in improving Claude. Anthropic will maintain a free tier, and the company says that it may also offer lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing in the future if there is demand for it. Claude Pro is priced at &#36;20 per month, which is the same price as ChatGPT's higher-end Plus tier.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAn ad-free Claude experience isn't a sure thing forever, as Anthropic gives itself an out in the blog post: \"Should we need to revisit this approach, we'll be transparent about our reasons for doing so.\"<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/anthropic/\">Anthropic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/\">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/anthropic-clause-no-ads/\">Anthropic Promises Claude Will Remain Ad-Free, Mocks ChatGPT Ads in Super Bowl Commercial</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/anthropic-promises-claude-will-remain-ad-free-mocks-chatgpt-ads-in-super-bowl-commercial.2477194/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/apple-seeds-ios-26-3-rc/\">iOS 26.3 release candidate</a> includes references to a pair of unreleased chips that are in the M5 family, according to information found by <a href=\"https://x.com/nicolas09F9/\">Nicolás Alvarez</a> and shared with <em>MacRumors</em>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/m5-macbook-pro-cyber.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028591\" />\r<br/>\nThe iOS 26.3 RC mentions two unreleased SoCs, T6051 and T6052, with associated H17C and H17D platform names. The 17 is a reference to the M5, as the standard M5 chip is numbered H17G. Typically, the \"C\" lettering is used with a Max chip, and the \"D\" lettering is used for Ultra chips. G is used for standard chips, and S is used for Pro chips.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen using Apple's past numbering and lettering as a reference, that would suggest an <strong>M5 Max and an M5 Ultra chip</strong>. There is no current reference to T6050 H17S, which is the chip identifier and platform name we'd expect for the M5 Pro.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSince we're currently waiting on new versions of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, the chip references located are a bit confusing. We have three possibilities: there's an M5 Pro chip along with an M5 Max and M5 Ultra chip and it's just not added to the iOS 26.3 code yet, Apple is changing its numbering, or Apple is planning for M5 Max and M5 Ultra &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Chip 1 in the beta</strong>: T6051, H17C. Presumably M5 Max.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Chip 2 in the beta</strong>: T6052, H17D. Presumably M5 Ultra.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><strong>Not in the beta</strong>: T6050, H17S. Chip identifier expected for M5 Pro.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nApple's past Max chips have all used \"C\" lettering, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/\">M1 Max</a> (H13C), <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> Max (H14C), M3 Max (H15C/H15M), and M4 Max (H16C). There was also an M variant of the M3 Max for the 14-core chip, with Apple using C for the 16-core chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUltra chips have all used \"D\" lettering, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-ultra/\">M1 Ultra</a> (H13D), &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra (H14D), and M3 Ultra (H15D). There was no M4 Ultra chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt's not clear why we are only seeing signs of an M5 Max and M5 Ultra chip, but rumors suggest that new &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models with higher-end M5 chips are set to launch in the next few weeks. Apple is supposedly working on a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a> in the M5 family, which would use an M5 Ultra chip, but we haven't heard rumors about an upcoming launch.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/new-m5-chips-ios-26-3-beta/\">New M5 Chips Spotted in iOS 26.3 Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-m5-chips-spotted-in-ios-26-3-beta.2477190/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Prime members can access Alexa+ by saying \"Alexa, upgrade to Alexa+,\" or by logging into their Amazon account on the Alexa website.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlexa+ has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/26/amazon-debuts-alexa-plus-generative-ai/\">been in testing</a> since February 2025, offering a smarter, more personalized, and more proactive assistant experience. Amazon says Alexa+ is much more capable than the prior version of Alexa thanks to its updated architecture that uses large language models from Amazon Nova and Anthropic.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlexa is able to do things like order takeout, make restaurant reservations, book rides, and schedule home repairs, plus it can control smart home products and answer questions like any other chatbot. It integrates with Amazon services, and can integrate with hardware like Ring cameras.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAmazon Prime in the U.S. is priced at &#36;14.99 per month or &#36;139 per year, and Alexa+ is considered one of the Prime benefits. Customers without Prime can try Alexa+ through a limited, free chat experience on Alexa.com and in the Alexa app. Subscribing solely to Alexa+ costs &#36;19.99 per month, which makes no sense for anyone since Prime is cheaper.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAmazon's revamped Alexa+ experience is seeing a wide rollout a couple months ahead of when Apple is expected to debut a more powerful, personalized version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is going to get an update in spring 2026, likely in iOS 26.4.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlexa and &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; were two of the original large-scale voice assistants, so it will be interesting to see how Alexa+ compares to the revamped version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; when &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; launches.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon/\">Amazon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/amazon-alexa-plus-prime/\">Amazon&#039;s Alexa+ Now Free for All U.S. Prime Members, Beating Apple&#039;s Smarter Siri to Market</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/amazons-alexa-now-free-for-all-u-s-prime-members-beating-apples-smarter-siri-to-market.2477183/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Both sets of glasses will connect to a smartphone, with processing done on that device. The glasses will run Android XR, Google's platform for wearables.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGoogle is partnering with Samsung to develop the glasses, plus it is working with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster, two companies that design eyeglasses. Google says that its glasses options will be stylish, lightweight, and comfortable enough to wear all day.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Google smart glasses will compete with the Meta Ray-Bans and any upcoming products from Apple. Meta already has Ray-Ban and Oakley glasses with AI and Ray-Bans <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/18/meta-launches-ai-glasses/\">with an in-lens display</a>.

The lawsuit names Pam Bondi, Kristi Noem, and other government officials, accusing them of First Amendment violations (via <em><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/12/08/nx-s1-5631826/iceblock-app-lawsuit-trump-bondi\">NPR</a></em>). \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/iceblock-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1660\" height=\"934\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029499\" />\r<br/>\nKey to the lawsuit is a statement from Bondi, who claimed Apple removed the app after the government asked Apple to do so. \"We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; -- and Apple did so,\" said Bondi.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nICEBlock allows <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users to report the location of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents when the agents are spotted in public. The app was removed from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; in early October, though people who downloaded it before it was pulled are still able to use it. ICEBlock had over a million users when it was removed from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nJoshua Aaron, the app's developer, argues that the creation, distribution, and promotion of ICEBlock is lawful and protected by the First Amendment. He claims that the government officials named in the lawsuit used the authority of their offices to pressure, threaten, and coerce Apple to remove the app.\r<br/>\n<blockquote>This lawsuit challenges these government officials' unconstitutional threats and demands against Apple, which pressured it to remove the ICEBlock app from the App Store. In particular, Attorney General Bondi's coercion of Apple has censored Aaron and ALL U Chart,Inc., which owns ICEBlock's intellectual property, by making ICEBlock--their speech--unavailable to the public.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nApple is not named in the lawsuit, and is not being targeted by Aaron. When the app was removed from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, Apple said that the app violated guideline 1.1.1, and made it clear that it was removed at the behest of the government.\r<br/>\n<blockquote>Information provided to Apple by law enforcement shows that your app violates Guideline 1.1.1 because its purpose is to provide location information about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group. For this reason, your app will be removed from the App Store</blockquote>\r<br/>\nAaron asks that the court allow ICEBlock to be reinstated, and that government officials be prevented from threatening or pressuring ICEBlock distributors.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/08/iceblock-dev-sues-trump-administration/\">ICEBlock App Developer Sues Trump Officials, Claims Apple Was Pressured to Remove App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iceblock-app-developer-sues-trump-officials-claims-apple-was-pressured-to-remove-app.2474398/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

We've listed every product that works with our exclusive MRHOLIDAY discount code below, so be sure to shop the sale before it ends on December 15.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Wall Chargers</h3>\r<br/>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/48nUhO2\">67W On The Go Slim Wall Charger</a> - &#36;42.00, down from &#36;59.99</li>\r<br/>\n<li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/4rYNMZQ\">165W USB-C 4-Port GaN Charger</a> - &#36;84.00, down from &#36;119.99</li></ul>\r<br/>\n<h3>Wireless Chargers</h3>\r<br/>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/4pqUk1J\">2-in-1 Headphone Stand and Wireless Charger</a> - &#36;39.20, down from &#36;55.99\r<br/>\n<li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/4qNs1M1\">2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Charging Stand</a> - &#36;56.00, down from &#36;79.99</li>\r<br/>\n<li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/4p5lzhz\">On The Go 2-in-1 Charger</a> - &#36;56.00, down from &#36;79.99</li>\r<br/>\n<li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/4qYVUcj\">On The Go 3-in-1 Charger</a> - &#36;70.00, down from &#36;99.99</li>\r<br/>\n<li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/3JPOGqd\">3-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Charging Stand</a> - &#36;91.00, down from &#36;129.99</li></ul>\r<br/>\n<h3>Bluetooth Trackers</h3>\r<br/>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/4oB4QD5\">FindAll Keychain</a> - &#36;21.00, down from &#36;29.99</li>\r<br/>\n<li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/4oUfQLi\">FindAll Card</a> - &#36;24.50, down from &#36;34.99</li>\r<br/>\n<li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/3XhWAvA\">FindAll Luggage Tag</a> - &#36;31.50, down from &#36;44.99</li>\r<br/>\n<li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/47Ed6e0\">FindAll Glasses Case</a> - &#36;35.00, down from &#36;49.99</li>\r<br/>\n<li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/4oJov2V\">FindAll Passport Cover</a> - &#36;42.00, down from &#36;59.99</li></ul>\r<br/>\n<h3>Docks and Hubs</h3>\r<br/>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/44dBzpP\">Pro Hub Slim</a> - &#36;56.00, down from &#36;79.99</li>\r<br/>\n<li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/4pVqqCf\">7-in-1 Slim USB-C Multiport Adapter</a> - &#36;56.00, down from &#36;79.99</li>\r<br/>\n<li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/4iJQHkB\">Thunderbolt 4 Slim Hub Pro</a> - &#36;140.00, down from &#36;199.99</li>\r<br/>\n<li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/4aA3XpV\">Thunderbolt 4 Dock</a> - &#36;147.00, down from &#36;209.99</li>\r<br/>\n<li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/4pmjwWR\">Thunderbolt 4 Multimedia Pro Dock</a> - &#36;245.00, down from &#36;349.99</li></ul>\r<br/>\n<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>\r<br/>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/4iHcn0N\">On The Go Bluetooth Keyboard</a> - &#36;56.00, down from 479.99</li>\r<br/>\n<li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/3KNJ6oH\">On The Go Bluetooth Mouse</a> - &#36;21.00, down from &#36;29.99</li>\r<br/>\n<li><a href=\"https://tidd.ly/3XDfCge\">Thunderbolt 4 Pro Cable</a> - &#36;28.00, down from &#36;39.99</li></ul>\r<br/>\nIf you're on the hunt for more discounts, be sure to visit our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a> roundup where we recap the best Apple-related bargains of the past week.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<hr />\r<br/>\n<div class=\"no-raptive\">\r<br/>\n<h3>Deals Newsletter</h3>\r<br/>\nInterested in hearing more about the best deals you can find this holiday season? <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/itTnTk\">Sign up</a> for our Deals Newsletter and we'll keep you updated so you don't miss the biggest deals of the season!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;margin-bottom:2em;\">\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<form action=\"http://macrumors.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=7d0106b433773bd0aef5828e0&amp;id=eebad02bf4&amp;f_id=00fbede0f0\" method=\"post\" id=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" name=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" class=\"validate\" target=\"_blank\" novalidate><input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" size=\"30\" class=\"required email\" id=\"mce-EMAIL\"  placeholder=\"Enter Email Address\" title=\"Email Address\" /><div class=\"response\" id=\"mce-error-response\" style=\"display:none\"></div><div class=\"response\" id=\"mce-success-response\" style=\"display:none\"></div><div style=\"position: absolute; left: -5000px;\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"b_7d0106b433773bd0aef5828e0_eebad02bf4\" tabindex=\"-1\" value=\"\" title=\"form\" /></div><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" name=\"subscribe\" id=\"mc-embedded-subscribe\" class=\"button\"></div>\r<br/>\n</div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/08/macrumors-readers-30-off-satechi/\">MacRumors Readers Can Get 30% Off Satechi&#039;s Best Qi2 Chargers, Bluetooth Trackers, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macrumors-readers-can-get-30-off-satechis-best-qi2-chargers-bluetooth-trackers-and-more.2474384/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The filing shows that Cook now holds about 105,000 Nike shares, a position valued at nearly &#36;6 million.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNike shares rose following the disclosure, gaining between about 2% and 5% in premarket and early regular-session activity, after the stock had fallen sharply in the days following the company's most recent earnings report, which highlighted ongoing challenges in its business, particularly in China. Nike is currently in the early stages of a turnaround effort under CEO Elliott Hill, who returned to the company last year after retiring. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCook has served on Nike's board of directors since 2005 and is its lead independent director, a role he assumed in 2016 after Nike co-founder Phil Knight stepped down as chairman. In addition to his position at Apple, Cook also chairs Nike's compensation committee, placing him in a central governance role at the apparel maker. The December 22 transaction represents Cook's largest open-market purchase of Nike shares in years and comes at a time when the company is under pressure from investors following a prolonged decline in its stock price.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/24/tim-cook-buys-nike-shares/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook Buys &#36;3 Million of Nike Shares</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-buys-3-million-of-nike-shares.2475157/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The case began in 2022 and examined whether Apple's restrictions on app distribution and payments limited competition in Brazil.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCADE said the investigation focused on Apple's prohibition of third-party app stores on iOS, the requirement that developers use Apple's in-app purchase system for digital goods and subscriptions, and restrictions that prevented developers from informing users about alternative payment options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUnder the settlement, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/23/ios-alternative-app-stores-brazil/\">will be required</a> to allow developers in Brazil to link to external payment options and promote offers that take place outside their apps. Developers will also be permitted to offer third-party payment methods within their apps alongside Apple's own in-app purchase system, with CADE requiring that these options be presented next to Apple's payment option.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple will also have to allow third-party app stores in Brazil. CADE specified that Apple may still display warnings or informational messages to users, but those messages must be neutral, objective, and limited in scope, and must not introduce extra steps or barriers that make alternative options harder to use. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAccording to Brazilian technology site <em><a href=\"https://tecnoblog.net/noticias/apple-ainda-podera-cobrar-taxas-no-brasil-veja-aliquotas/\">Tecnoblog</a></em>, which said it obtained the details directly from CADE, purchases made through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; will remain subject to a 10% or 25% commission under standard terms. Developers who use Apple's payment system would also pay a 5% transaction fee.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf an app directs users to pay outside the app using only static text, with no clickable link or button, Apple will not charge a fee. If the app includes a clickable button or link that sends users to an external website for payment, Apple will charge a 15% fee. Third-party app stores will be subject to a 5% Core Technology Commission.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCADE said Apple will have up to 105 days to implement the required changes once the new rules become binding. <div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/brazil/\">Brazil</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/24/new-app-store-fee-structure-in-brazil/\">Apple to Introduce New App Store Fee Structure in Brazil Following Antitrust Settlement</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-introduce-new-app-store-fee-structure-in-brazil-following-antitrust-settlement.2475156/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 17e is said to already be in mass production ahead of unveiling at a spring product launch event. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe rumor comes in contrast to an array of corroborated reports that the second-generation &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; has been delayed until <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/16/when-to-expect-iphone-air-2-and-iphone-20/\">March 2027</a>, where it is expected to launch alongside the standard <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/\">iPhone 18</a> and a lower-end &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18e. The second-generation &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; was originally rumored to launch alongside the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro, &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro Max, and foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in the fall of 2026, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/22/iphone-air-supply-chain-cuts/\">poor sales</a> of the debut model apparently led Apple to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/10/next-generation-iphone-air-delayed/\">delay the launch</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe second-generation &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; is rumored to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/iphone-air-2-two-rumored-changes/\">address complaints</a> about the device by adding a second rear camera and lowering its  price. A lighter weight, vapor chamber cooling, and a larger battery capacity are also among the rumored new features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt is still possible that a new &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; could launch in the fall of next year, especially if Apple has expedited development of new features, since this was the original scheduled launch time frame. Nevertheless, it would be surprising if the multitude of rumors indicating a delayed launch were mistaken. <div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/\">iPhone Air</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/\">Fixed Focus Digital</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-Air\">iPhone Air (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/24/iphone-air-2-could-still-launch-next-year/\">iPhone Air 2 Could Still Launch Next Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-air-2-could-still-launch-next-year.2475154/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

However, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-discontinues-iphone-se/\">iPhone SE line was entirely discontinued</a> when the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e launched</a>, and the iPhone Plus line is being phased out.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBelow, we have listed 25 products that were discontinued by Apple this year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>iPhones</h2>\r<br/>\nApple discontinued the third-generation iPhone SE in February, after introducing the iPhone 16e. As a result, Apple no longer sells any iPhone models with a Home button, Touch ID, LCD screen, a sub-6-inch screen size, or Lightning.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe original iPhone SE was released in March 2016. That model's design was largely based on the iPhone 5s, with key specs including a 4-inch display, a Touch ID home button, and an aluminum and glass frame with chamfered edges. However, the device was powered by a newer A9 chip from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple went on to release two more iPhone SE models in 2020 and 2022, respectively, with those devices having a similar design as the iPhone 8.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMeanwhile, the iPhone Plus has effectively been replaced by the ultra-thin iPhone Air in Apple's smartphone lineup. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-discontinues-iphone-14/\">Both the iPhone 14 Plus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/apple-discontinues-iphone-15/\">iPhone 15 Plus were discontinued</a> this year, and it is only a matter of time before the iPhone 16 Plus is axed too. Apple is not expected to release another Plus model in the foreseeable future.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHere are all of the iPhone models that were discontinued this year:<ul><li>iPhone 16 Pro Max (succeeded by iPhone 17 Pro Max)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>iPhone 16 Pro (succeeded by iPhone 17 Pro)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>iPhone 15 Plus</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>iPhone 15</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>iPhone 14 Plus</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>iPhone 14</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>iPhone SE (succeeded by iPhone 16e)</li></ul><h2>iPads</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/m2-iPad-Air-Horizontal-Feature-Blue-and-Purple.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-950735\" />\r<br/>\nIt was a spec-bump year for the iPad lineup, with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and entry-level iPad all receiving faster chips, but no major design changes.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHere are all of the iPad models that were discontinued this year:<ul>\r<br/>\n  <li>iPad Pro with M4 chip (updated with M5 chip)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>iPad Air with M2 chip (updated with M3 chip)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>iPad 10 (updated with A16 chip)</li></ul><h2>Apple Watches</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-Jet-Black.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"898\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-965089\" />\r<br/>\nApple Watch Series 11 is a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-10-vs-series-11/\">very minor upgrade over the now-discontinued Series 10</a>, but the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and Apple Watch SE 3 offer some more meaningful changes. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/no-new-apple-watch-chip-for-the-first-time/\">None of the latest Apple Watch models received a new chip</a>, though.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHere are all of the Apple Watch models that were discontinued this year:<ul>\r<br/>\n  <li>Apple Watch Ultra 2 (succeeded by Apple Watch Ultra 3)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Apple Watch Series 10 (succeeded by Apple Watch Series 11)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Apple Watch SE 2 (succeeded by Apple Watch SE 3)</li></ul><h2>Macs</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1440\" height=\"810\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-919466\" />\r<br/>\nHere are all of the Mac models that were discontinued this year:<ul>\r<br/>\n  <li>Mac Studio with M2 Max and M2 Ultra chips (updated with M4 Max and M3 Ultra chips)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 chip (updated with M5 chip)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air with M3 chip (updated with M4 chip)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>13-inch MacBook Air with M2 chip</li></ul><h2>Other</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/30W-USB-C-Power-Adapter.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2034\" height=\"1144\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018880\" />\r<br/>\nHere are other Apple products and accessories that were discontinued this year:<ul>\r<br/>\n  <li>AirPods Pro 2 (succeeded by AirPods Pro 3)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Apple Vision Pro with M2 chip (updated with M5 chip)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>MagSafe Charger with Qi 2 (succeeded by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/10/apple-releases-new-magsafe-charger/\">MagSafe Charger with Qi 2.2 support</a>)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>30W USB-C Power Adapter (succeeded by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/17/apple-40w-to-60w-charger-key-advantage/\">40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max</a>)*</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Lightning to 3.5mm Audio Cable (succeeded by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-selling-usb-c-to-3-5mm-audio-cable/\">USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Cable</a>)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>MagSafe to MagSafe 2 Converter</li></ul>* In the U.S., U.K., Canada, Japan, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/13/apple-40w-dynamic-power-adapter/\">select other countries</a> only.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDid we miss anything?

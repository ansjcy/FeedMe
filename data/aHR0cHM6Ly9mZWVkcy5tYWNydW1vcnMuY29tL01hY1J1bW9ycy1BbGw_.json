That would include the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone Fold, and it would match the 12GB of RAM included in the iPhone 17 Pro models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn a research note last week, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>, analyst Jeff Pu agreed that the iPhone 18 Pro models and iPhone Fold will have 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt has been rumored that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/25/iphone-18-to-feature-more-ram/\">even the standard iPhone 18 will have 12GB of RAM</a>, which would be an increase over the 8GB of RAM in the standard iPhone 17.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHere is how much RAM is in the latest iPhones:<ul><li><strong>iPhone 17:</strong> 8GB</li>\r<br/>\n<li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro:</strong> 12GB</li>\r<br/>\n<li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro Max:</strong> 12GB</li>\r<br/>\n<li><strong>iPhone Air:</strong> 12GB</li></ul>Here is how much RAM is expected in the next iPhones:<ul><li><strong>iPhone 18:</strong> 12GB</li>\r<br/>\n<li><strong>iPhone 18 Pro:</strong> 12GB</li>\r<br/>\n<li><strong>iPhone 18 Pro Max:</strong> 12GB</li>\r<br/>\n<li><strong>iPhone Fold:</strong> 12GB</li></ul>Apple is expected to release the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max in September, but the standard iPhone 18 is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/01/no-iphone-18-launch-this-year/\">not expected to be announced until around March 2027</a>, as Apple is reportedly shifting to a new two-phase launch strategy.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor the iPhone 18 Pro's A20 Pro chip, RAM will reportedly be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/iphone-18-pro-a20-chip-with-new-design/\">integrated directly onto the chip's wafer</a> with the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine, rather than being adjacent to the chip and connected with a silicon interposer.

      "content": "As noted <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/18/heres-why-walmart-still-doesnt-support-apple-pay/\">by <em>9to5Mac</em></a> over the weekend, Walmart still does not accept contactless payment options like Apple Pay at its more than 4,500 stores across the U.S., and there is no indication that will be changing any time soon.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Apple-Pay-Walmart-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1120\" height=\"630\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-986773\" />\r<br/>\nIt is not just Apple Pay that is affected. Walmart also does not allow customers to use Google Pay or Samsung Pay, and you cannot tap a credit or debit card either. In other words, the NFC functionality on the payment terminals is turned off.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt is far from the first time that we have reported on this topic, but Walmart has still not changed course, despite endless customer complaints.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLast year, a Walmart spokesperson told <em>MacRumors</em> that the retailer <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/walmart-reiterates-why-it-doesnt-accept-apple-pay/\">remained focused on its own payment technologies</a> in the Walmart app, including <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/cp/walmart-pay/3205993\">Walmart Pay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/cp/scan-go/9679980\">Scan & Go</a>, but these options are not as convenient as one-tap Apple Pay.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTo use Walmart Pay, customers must add a payment card to the Walmart app, and then scan a QR code displayed at the checkout to complete payment. This system allows Walmart to track a customer's purchase history and learn their habits, which is likely the biggest underlying reason that the retailer does not accept Apple Pay.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nScan & Go allows Walmart+ members to save time by scanning barcodes on items while they shop, rather than having to scan all of the items at a self-checkout register later. This can save you time, but Apple Pay is still not accepted.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple Pay has a lot of privacy protections, including hiding actual credit card numbers, and this would make it harder for Walmart to track customers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple Pay launched <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/17/apple-celebrates-10-years-of-apple-pay/\">more than 10 years ago</a>, and it was accepted at more than 90 percent of U.S. retailers as of 2022, according to Apple. Some other major Apple Pay holdouts in the U.S. have reversed course and started accepting it over the past few years, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/09/home-depot-and-heb-rolling-out-apple-pay/\">including The Home Depot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/26/lowes-apple-pay/\">Lowe's</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/15/kroger-fred-meyer-apple-pay/\">Kroger</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/09/home-depot-and-heb-rolling-out-apple-pay/\">Texas grocery store chain H-E-B</a>, leaving Walmart as one of the country's only major retailers that does not accept Apple Pay.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nInterestingly enough, Walmart has accepted Apple Pay in Canada since 2020, but apparently it is not willing to offer that luxury in America for now.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/walmart/\">Walmart</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134\">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/19/walmart-no-apple-pay/\">Walmart Still Doesn&#039;t Accept Apple Pay in the U.S. in 2026, Here&#039;s Why</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/walmart-still-doesnt-accept-apple-pay-in-the-u-s-in-2026- heres-why.2476294/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "While most sources in the Apple rumor scene agree that the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max will feature under-screen Face ID, there continues to be conflicting rumors about how that change might impact the Dynamic Island.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/iPhone-Top-Left-Hole-Punch-Feature-Blue.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032879\" />\r<br/>\nIn a post on social media platform X today, the account <a href=\"https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/2013228811975053466\">\"ShrimpApplePro\" claimed</a> that the Dynamic Island will be \"shorter\" on the iPhone 18 Pro models, as a result of some Face ID components moving under the screen. Only the front camera and Face ID's infrared camera will remain visible on the devices, they said.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"ShrimpApplePro\" has accurately leaked some details about devices like the iPhone 15 Pro and Apple Watch Series 9 in the past, but they are not always correct. Early rumors should always be treated with some skepticism.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLast month, <em>The Information</em> said that the front camera would be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/iphone-18-pro-features-report/\">moved to the top-left corner of the screen</a> on the iPhone 18 Pro models. The report explicitly said this change would help to eliminate the pill-shaped cutout in the screen, but \"ShrimpApplePro\" evidently believes that the Dynamic Island will live on in a smaller way.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYouTube channel Front Page Tech mocked up an iPhone 18 Pro with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/19/iphone-18-pro-dynamic-island-top-left-corner/\">both the front camera and a smaller Dynamic Island in the top-left corner of the screen</a>, but the video might simply be combining the two rumors mentioned above.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile the exact implementation remains to be seen, the good news is that it really does sound like under-screen Face ID is finally happening this year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSouth Korean publication <a href=\"https://www.etnews.com/20260119000301\"><em>ETNews</em> today reported</a> (via \"<a href=\"https://x.com/jukan05/status/2013151757044457511\">Jukan</a>\") that the iPhone 18 Pro models will use under-screen infrared technology from Samsung, which would pave the way for under-screen Face ID. The report also said the devices will use so-called LTPO+ display technology, which would likely be more power efficient than the current LTPO technology in the iPhone 17 series. This upgrade should contribute to longer battery life.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is expected to unveil the iPhone 18 Pro models in September, and hopefully the Face ID and Dynamic Island rumors are more clear by then.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<strong>Update:</strong> \"ShrimpApplePro\" has since deleted their post.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/\">iPhone 18</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/etnews-com/\">ETNews</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/face-id/\">Face ID</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shrimpapplepro/\">ShrimpApplePro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/19/iphone-18-pro-face-id-ltpo-plus-rumors/\">iPhone 18 Pro Will Reportedly Have an LTPO+ Display With Under-Screen Face ID</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-18-pro-will-reportedly-have-an-ltpo-display-with-under-screen-face-id.2476288/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

While X continues to attract more mobile users than Threads in the United States, Similarweb estimates that X's U.S. daily active mobile user base has declined significantly, falling to roughly half of what it was a year earlier, as Threads continues to gain ground.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDespite Threads' gains on mobile, Similarweb's data shows that X maintains a decisive lead when web usage is included. As of January 13, 2026, X was attracting an estimated 145.4 million daily web visitors, compared with approximately 8.5 million daily web visitors for Threads. When mobile and web audiences are combined, X is estimated to exceed 270 million daily users, while Threads totals roughly 150 million daily users across platforms.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/\">Meta</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/\">Twitter</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/19/threads-usage-overtakes-x-on-mobile/\">Threads Usage Overtakes X on Mobile</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/threads-usage-overtakes-x-on-mobile.2476275/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

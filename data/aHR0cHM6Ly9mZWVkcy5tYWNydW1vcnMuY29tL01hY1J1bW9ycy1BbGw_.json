      "content": "Two senior Apple executives are leaving the company, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/apple-announces-executive-transitions/\">Apple announced today</a>. Apple's Senior Vice President and General Counsel Kate Adams and Lisa Jackson, Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, are both retiring in 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-Logo-16x9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-924188\" />\r<br/>\nAdams will be replaced with Jennifer Newstead, who will join Apple as a senior vice president on January 1, and will become Apple's general counsel on March 1, 2026. Newstead is currently Meta's chief legal officer, and she was previously the Legal Adviser to the United States Department of State.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen Newstead takes over as general counsel, Adams will not immediately leave. She will instead oversee the Government Affairs organization after Jackson retires in late January 2026. Adams will remain at Apple until late 2026, at which point Newstead will take over. Newstead will ultimately oversee both Apple's Legal and Government Affairs organizations as Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Government Affairs.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn a statement, Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> said that he is pleased to merge Legal and Government Affairs because of increasing overlap between the two teams.\r<br/>\n<blockquote>We couldn't be more pleased to have Jennifer join our team,\" said Cook. \"She brings an extraordinary depth of experience and skill to the role, and will advance Apple's important work all over the world. We are also pleased that Jennifer will be overseeing both the Legal and Government Affairs organizations, given the increasing overlap between the work of both teams and her substantial background in international affairs. I know she will be an excellent leader going forward.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nJackson's other responsibilities, which include Environment and Social Initiatives, will be taken over by Chief Operating Officer Sabih Khan. Cook said that Jackson played an important role in helping Apple achieve its environmental goals.\r<br/>\n<blockquote>I am deeply appreciative of Lisa's contributions. She has been instrumental in helping us reduce our global greenhouse emissions by more than 60 percent compared to 2015 levels,\" said Cook. \"She has also been a critical strategic partner in engaging governments around the world, advocating for the best interests of our users on a myriad of topics, as well as advancing our values, from education and accessibility to privacy and security.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nAdams has been with Apple since 2017, and before that, she worked for Honeywell. Jackson joined Apple in 2013 after serving as Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and she has been the face of Apple's environmental messaging since then.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's announcement comes shortly after <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/apple-alan-dye-joining-meta/\">lead interface designer Alan Dye</a> left the company, and after AI chief John Giannandrea's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/apple-ai-chief-retiring-after-siri-failure/\">retirement announcement</a>. Earlier this year, Apple lost Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/08/jeff-williams-stepping-down-as-apple-coo/\">who is retiring</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-cfo-luca-maestri-stepping-down/\">Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri</a>. There have also been rumors about Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; retiring, with rumors suggesting he is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/15/report-tim-cook-to-step-down-as-soon-as-next-year/\">preparing to leave his role</a> as soon as 2026.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/04/two-more-apple-executives-retiring/\">Apple General Counsel Kate Adams and Environment Chief Lisa Jackson Retiring in 2026</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-general-counsel-kate-adams-and-environment-chief-lisa-jackson-retiring-in-2026.2474243/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

This is the first Bluetti power station that I've reviewed, but I have experience with larger power banks from Jackery, DJI, Anker, and other companies. The Elite 30 V2 has a LiFePO4 battery, which Bluetti says will last for over 3,000 charging cycles and 10 years. There's a five-year warranty, which is solid.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/bluetti-main-table.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029174\" />\r<br/>\nMost power stations are utilitarian, with a black or gray plastic design, but the Elite 30 V2 comes in several fun colors. There's nothing wrong with a simple design for battery equipment, but colors make Bluetti's little power station stand out. The model I tested is green, but it also comes in blue, purple, pink, light gray, and dark gray.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAppearance isn't going to matter to most, but if you're going to have a battery out for people to use at the beach, on a camping trip, at the park, or during some other activity, it might as well have some pizazz. The power station is just about 9.5 pounds, and it measures 9.8 inches long, 7 inches wide and 6.6 inches tall. There's a handle for carrying it, and an LCD display shows you input, output, charge level, and an estimate of how long the power will last based on what's plugged in.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/bluetti-elite-side.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029175\" />\r<br/>\nThe Elite 30 V2 supports 600W charging, though it can handle up to 1500W temporarily as part of a Power Lifting mode. The Elite 30 V2 has more ports than you might even need on a power station this size, and it can charge up multiple devices at a time. There's a 140W USB-C port, a 100W USB-C port, two 15W USB-A ports, and two AC outlets. There are also AC and DC inputs for charging, a cigarette lighter port, a grounding terminal, and a pair of 12V/8A barrel ports. Both USB-C ports can be used at full power at the same time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere's a power button, a button to turn on DC power to the USB-C/USB-A ports, and an AC button to turn on power to the AC outlets. When you plug something in, you have to turn on power to the appropriate port before charging will begin. It's also a good idea to turn it off when you're done to ensure there's no power drain when you're not charging anything. The power stations that I've tested in the past haven't had separate buttons for DC power (just AC power), but that's the way Bluetti's power stations are designed.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/bluetti-elite-front-off.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029176\" />\r<br/>\nI've been using the Elite 30 V2 to charge my Apple devices for the last several weeks to get an idea of what it's useful for. Charging my <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a> Max from 0 to 80 percent drains the power station from 100 percent to 90 percent, and it's about the same for an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> Pro Max and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 15 Pro Max.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI can charge my &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s battery between 9 and 10 times, though I do limit my charging to 80 percent. The variation is because the power station's battery level can drop slightly with nothing plugged in unless it's turned off. Over a four-hour period, the battery dropped around 10 percent with DC power on.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/bluetti-elite-back.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029177\" />\r<br/>\nIt charges my <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> three and a half times. It was able to run my <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>, Studio Display, and two lights (my desk setup) for half of my work day (12:51 p.m. to right around 5:00 p.m.). It ranged from 60W to 110W depending on workload. Charging takes around an hour and 20 minutes to get to full, though it can get to an 85 percent charge in around 50 minutes. It can charge through a cigarette lighter port in a car, or with solar panels for off-grid connectivity.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Elite 30 V2 isn't the power station you want to get to run something that's power hungry like an electric heater, but it's good for smaller things like computers, lights, speakers, and consoles. You could run a mini refrigerator for a few hours, a hair dryer or flat iron long enough to do your hair, or a lower power electric kettle or coffee maker. It is able to run my entire computer setup, plus it can power my Wi-Fi for a full work day. Some people use power stations as backups for medical devices. The Elite 30 V2 may be able to run a CPAP machine for a night's sleep, but that will depend on the individual machine. I wouldn't recommend this one for other devices like an oxygen concentrator, which would draw too much power and require a much larger battery for an extended power outage.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/bluetti-elite-size-comparison.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029178\" />\r<br/>\nYou can use the Elite 30 V2 as a backup in case of a power outage, plugging a device into it and then plugging the power station into an outlet. In that situation, the power station will kick on automatically in a power outage with no interruption in function (Bluetti says there's a super fast 10ms response time). It actually supports up to 980W of passthrough power.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSince the Elite 30 V2 is a smaller power station, it runs and charges quietly. It is nearly silent when charging and when powering things like iPhones and Macs. The fan inside will kick on under higher loads, but it's still not unreasonably loud. I can hear it, but it's a noise I could sleep through.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/bluetti-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029179\" />\r<br/>\nThere is a Bluetti app, and you can connect to the power station via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to monitor it remotely. The app tells you what's drawing power and how much, how long the battery will last under the current load, and your energy usage statistics. You can also remotely turn the AC/DC power on or off, choose power modes, and enable the 1500W Power Lifting feature. You should also be able to upgrade the firmware, but it wasn't working properly for me in the app (the button to actually install firmware was blank).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Bottom Line</h2>\r<br/>\nI'm a fan of the Elite 30 V2. It provides enough power to charge multiple phones, tablets, portable gaming systems, or computers, but it's not too heavy to carry around. For an active use power station that you're using for day or weekend trips where portability is an issue, this is one of the better power stations that you can get.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/bluetti-camping.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029173\" />\r<br/>\nI am petite and can struggle to haul around some of the bigger power 20lb+ stations that I've tested, but this one is the perfect size. I'm more likely to use a power station that is convenient for me to carry and take places.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis would be ideal as a backup battery if you just wanted to power smaller devices like smartphones and your router in a power outage. For medical devices or appliances that draw a lot of power, a bigger battery would be better.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSome power stations can cost over &#36;1,000, but the Elite 30 V2 is much more affordable. The MSRP is &#36;304, but it's often on sale.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>How to Buy</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Bluetti Elite 30 V2 Portable Power Station can be <a href=\"https://www.bluettipower.com/products/bluetti-elite-30-v2-portable-power-station-600w-288wh-twilight-glow-purple?variant=47844900372699&amp;id=68fc4417e4927262eccca83c\">purchased from the Bluetti website</a> for &#36;209 at the current time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<em><small>Note: Bluetti provided MacRumors with an Elite 30 V2 for the purpose of this review.

      "content": "Russia has blocked Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> video calling app in an ongoing effort to eliminate private communication methods, reports <em><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/russia-imposes-restrictions-apples-facetime-app-agencies-say-2025-12-04/\">Reuters</a></em>. Russia claims &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; is being used for criminal activity, and that blocking the app is a legitimate law enforcement measure. Social network Snapchat and multiplayer gaming platform Roblox were also banned this week.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/iOS-26-Glass-FaceTime-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1014636\" />\r<br/>\nMultiple other apps and services have been blocked in Russia previously. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord, and LinkedIn are unavailable and can't be accessed without a VPN. Russia throttles YouTube heavily to make it almost unusable, and since 2022, TikTok has had a Russia-only feed that does not include content from other countries.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nViber and Signal are banned in the country, and Russians are not able to make calls through WhatsApp or Telegram as of earlier this year. Messaging on those apps is also restricted.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn a statement to <em>Reuters</em>, Russia's media regulator Roskomnadzor said the following:\r<br/>\n<blockquote>According to law enforcement agencies, FaceTime is being used to organise and carry out terrorist attacks in the country, recruit perpetrators, and commit fraud and other crimes against Russian citizens.</blockquote>\r<br/>\n&zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; is now restricted nationwide, and has likely been blocked at the network level, so it may still be accessible through a VPN. Moscow residents are seeing a \"User unavailable\" message when attempting to use &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj;, which is the error displayed when a &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; call is unable to connect. The app still opens and activates, so Apple hasn't removed it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRussia claims that the app is used for coordinating illegal activity, with no option for the Federal Security Service (FSB) to monitor calls. Apple has declined to allow the FSB to access &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; traffic, and the company has not budged on end-to-end encryption.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; likely wasn't banned earlier because Russia initially focused on more widely used apps like WhatsApp and Telegram. When voice and video calling were banned in those apps, Russians transitioned to &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; as an alternative, making it a government target.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/russia/\">Russia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/04/russia-blocks-facetime/\">Russia Blocks Apple&#039;s FaceTime Amid Crackdown on Encrypted Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/russia-blocks-apples-facetime-amid-crackdown-on-encrypted-apps.2474233/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "In a statement shared with <em>Bloomberg</em> on Wednesday, Apple confirmed that its software design chief Alan Dye <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/apple-alan-dye-joining-meta/\">will be leaving</a>. Apple said Dye will be succeeded by Stephen Lemay, who has been a software designer at the company since 1999. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/Photos-App-Icon-Liquid-Glass.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005747\" />\r<br/>\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DR0Wsy0EhCP\">announced</a> that Dye will lead a new creative studio within the company's AR/VR division Reality Labs.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOn his blog <em>Daring Fireball</em>, longtime Apple commentator John Gruber has since reacted to the news with some <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/12/bad_dye_job\">scathing commentary about Dye</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nForemost, Gruber said Dye does not care about design.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"If you care about design, there's nowhere to go but down after leaving Apple,\" said Gruber, in a lengthy post citing conversations with Apple employees. \"What people overlooked is the obvious: Alan Dye doesn't actually care about design.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGruber said that everyone he spoke to inside and outside of Apple was \"happy\" — if not downright \"giddy\" — to learn that Lemay is replacing Dye.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"Lemay is well-liked personally and deeply respected talent-wise,\" he said.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"He has always set an extraordinarily high bar for excellence and embodies Apple's culture of collaboration and creativity,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said of Lemay, in his statement to <em>Bloomberg</em> that confirmed Dye is leaving the company.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDye was promoted to Vice President of Human Interface Design at Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2015/05/25/jony-ive-chief-design-officer/\">in 2015</a>, at the same time as Jony Ive became Chief Design Officer at the company. Gruber said this was a \"big mistake,\" as Dye had no background in user interface design.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLemay, on the other hand, is described as being a \"career\" interface designer with a particular \"attention to detail and craftsmanship.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe move from Dye to Lemay could be the best thing to happen to Apple's human interface design \"in the entire stretch since Steve Jobs's passing and Scott Forstall's ouster,\" according to Gruber. At the very least, he expects the move to \"stop the bleeding\" at Apple, both in terms of quality of work and talent retention.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDye is expected to begin his role at Meta at the end of December.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGruber's full post on <em>Daring Fireball</em>: \"<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/12/bad_dye_job\">Bad Dye Job</a>\"<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/alan-dye/\">Alan Dye</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/john-gruber/\">John Gruber</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/04/john-gruber-on-alan-dye/\">John Gruber Shares Scathing Commentary About Apple&#039;s Departing Software Design Chief</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/john-gruber-shares-scathing-commentary-about-apples-departing-software-design-chief.2474232/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

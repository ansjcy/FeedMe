      "content": "<a href=\"https://us.govee.com/\">Govee</a> today introduced three new HomeKit-compatible lighting products, including the Govee Floor Lamp 3, the Govee Ceiling Light Ultra, and the Govee Sky Ceiling Light.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/govee-floor-lamp.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1299\" height=\"731\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031256\" />\r<br/>\nThe Govee Floor Lamp 3 is the successor to the Floor Lamp 2, and it offers Matter integration with the option to connect to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a>. The Floor Lamp 3 offers an upgraded LuminBlend+ lighting system that can reproduce 281 trillion colors, and it supports 1000K to 10000K light temperature range.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLuminBlend+ is a color management system that offers accurate, true-to-life colors across any setting thanks to proprietary Gamma calibration. It supports an ultra-wide spectrum of lighting moods, and will be coming to additional Govee lights in 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGovee's 21-inch Matter-compatible Ceiling Light Ultra has a 616-LED matrix that can render detailed patterns and scenes. Visuals can be created with up to eight distinct layers of motion, color, and shapes, plus there are 20+ presets to choose from. Govee says that it provides sufficient illumination for family areas while also offering a natural, true-to-life appearance across objects and skin tones. The light offers 5000 lumen brightness for spaces between 200 and 300 square feet, and there is a 2700K to 6500K tunable white range that can shift throughout the day.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/govee-ceiling-light-ultra.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031257\" />\r<br/>\nThe 21-inch Sky Ceiling Light is meant to mimic natural daylight using a custom-engineered LED and gradient illumination to recreate sky tones from daytime blue to warm sunset gradients. It offers calming blue light that Govee says feels like looking up into a clear sky, with edge-mounted LEDs so that it looks like an architectural skylight. The light provides up to 5200 lumens of brightness, and it is designed to light spaces between 200 and 300 square feet.

      "content": "Happy New Year! We're kicking off 2026 with a look at everything we're expecting to see from Apple this year, including several new product categories, although hopefully Apple also has some surprises in store for us.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/top-stories-2026-01-03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031242\" />\r<br/>\nWe also went hands-on with a speculative 3D-printed mockup of one of those key new products, the so-called \"iPhone Fold,\" while this week also saw Fitness+ updates for those New Year's resolutions, some unreleased early prototype AirPods cases in fun colors, and more, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Top Stories</h2>\r<br/>\n<h3>Everything Apple Is Releasing in 2026: iPhone Fold, LLM Siri, Low-Cost MacBook and More</h3>\r<br/>\nIf rumors are accurate, 2026 is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/what-to-expect-from-apple-2026/\">going to be a huge year for Apple</a>. We're expecting the first foldable iPhone, an all-new home hub device, updated displays, and possibly, the first OLED MacBook Pro and the first AI smart glasses.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/Apple-26-Feature-2-With-Products-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031139\" />\r<br/>\nApple will split its iPhone launches, introduce a low-cost MacBook, and debut a much smarter, LLM-based version of Siri. In our 2026 guide, we've outlined <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/what-to-expect-from-apple-2026/\">everything we know about the new products coming from Apple this year</a>, based on current rumors.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Got a New iPhone 17? How to Use All the New Features</h3>\r<br/>\nApple's iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max have been available to buy since September, and a fair few will have been gifted over the holidays.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/iphone-17-pros-dan-hands-on.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022058\" />\r<br/>\nIf you're the proud owner of one of these devices, then <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/got-new-iphone-17-how-to-use-new-features/\">make sure to check out our overview of key features available in Apple's latest iPhone models</a>. Whether you're upgrading from an older iPhone or completely new to the devices, our summary of how-tos will help you get the most out your new ‌iPhone‌.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Hands-On With a Rough iPhone Fold Mockup</h3>\r<br/>\nApple is rumored to be introducing a foldable iPhone in September 2026, and since it will bring the biggest form factor change since the ‌iPhone‌ was introduced in 2007, curiosity about the design is high. A 3D designer created an \"iPhone Fold\" design based on rumors, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/29/foldable-iphone-mockup-hands-on/\">we printed it out to see how it compares to Apple's current iPhones</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/3D-Printed-iPhone-Fold-Thumb-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031045\" />\r<br/>\nThe foldable ‌iPhone‌ is going to be smaller than any current ‌iPhone‌ when it's closed, and it'll be shorter than Samsung's Galaxy foldables. Rumors suggest it'll be somewhere around 5.4 inches, which would make it as small as the now-discontinued ‌iPhone‌ 13 mini.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen unfolded, the upcoming ‌iPhone‌ Fold will be bigger than any ‌iPhone‌ to date, and not too far off in size from the original iPad mini. The current ‌iPad mini‌ has an 8.3-inch screen size, but the first models had a 7.9-inch display.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis new form factor will necessitate some updates to iOS to optimize the user experience, but there are still many unknowns <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/30/apple-pencil-iphone-fold/\">including whether or not the device will support the Apple Pencil</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Announces New Fitness+ Workout Programs, Strava Challenge, and More</h3>\r<br/>\nThe Apple Fitness+ Instagram account this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/30/apple-fitness-something-big/\">teased that the service has \"big plans\" for 2026</a>. In a video, several Apple Fitness+ trainers are shown holding up newspapers with headlines related to Apple Fitness+.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/Apple-Fitness-Plus-hero.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2164\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031179\" />\r<br/>\nOn Friday, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/02/apple-announces-new-fitness-workout-programs/\">announced a series of updates for Fitness+ and Apple Watch activity tracking</a>, including a New Year's activity challenge, a \"Quit Quitting\" challenge in the Strava app, new multi-week Fitness+ programs to help users stick to their fitness resolutions for 2026, new artist spotlights for workouts, and new Time to Walk episodes.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Tested AirPods in Bright Colors</h3>\r<br/>\nApple reportedly tested a version of the first-generation AirPods with bright, iPhone 5c-like colored charging cases.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/airpods-color-prototypes.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031010\" />\r<br/>\nThe images, shared by the Apple leaker and prototype collector known as \"Kosutami,\" <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/27/apple-tested-airpods-in-bright-colors/\">claim to show first-generation AirPods prototypes with pink and yellow exterior casings</a>. The interiors of the charging cases and the earbuds themselves remain white.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThey seem close to some of the color options offered for the ‌iPhone‌ 5c, which came in blue, green, pink, yellow and white. Apple has only ever released AirPods in white.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Report: Apple's AI Strategy Could Finally Pay Off in 2026</h3>\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/30/apple-ai-strategy-could-pay-off-in-2026/\">Apple's restrained artificial intelligence strategy may pay off in 2026</a> amid the arrival of a revamped Siri and concerns around the AI market \"bubble\" bursting, <em>The Information</em> argues.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-963424\" />\r<br/>\nThe speculative report argues that market sentiment toward AI spending is beginning to show signs of skepticism, with questions emerging over whether large investments by the likes of OpenAI, Google, and Meta can be justified by near-term revenue. Against that backdrop, Apple's decision to limit AI-specific capital expenditures has left it with more than &#36;130 billion in cash and marketable securities, giving the company the option to pursue acquisitions or partnerships if valuations of AI startups fall.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>MacRumors Newsletter</h2>\r<br/>\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/jan-1-2026\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/03/top-stories-apple-2026-plans/\">Top Stories: Apple&#039;s 2026 Plans, iPhone Fold Mockup Hands-On, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-apples-2026-plans-iphone-fold-mockup-hands-on-and-more.2475528/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple is planning to release a low-cost MacBook in 2026, which will apparently compete with more affordable Chromebooks and Windows PCs. Apple's most affordable Mac right now is the &#36;999 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, and the upcoming low-cost MacBook is expected to be cheaper. Here's what we know about the low-cost MacBook so far.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/Low-Cost-A18-Pro-MacBook-Feature-Pink.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028724\" />\r<br/>\n<h2>Size</h2>\r<br/>\nRumors suggest the low-cost MacBook will have a display that's around 13 inches in size. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has a 13.6-inch display, so the more affordable MacBook will likely be slightly smaller. It's sounding like it won't be too far off from the 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, though.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are no details on how thick it might be, but Apple probably won't prioritize a thin design for a machine optimized for a low price, even though some people are hoping that it will also be ultra thin. Ultra thin usually means more engineering work and higher-cost components for the display and other parts, but it can also sometimes be achieved by removing features. A thinner enclosure isn't entirely out of the question if Apple cuts features to reduce costs, but at the same time, reducing size leads to lower battery life, and Apple probably wants to have decent battery to compete with or outmatch cheap Windows laptops.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSince the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; can run fine with an M-series chip and no fan in an enclosure that's 0.44 inches thick, there's no real reason for the MacBook to be any thicker than that, unless Apple wants to add a bigger battery.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Design and Display</h2>\r<br/>\nThe low-cost MacBook will have a standard LCD display with no mini-LED technology or ProMotion refresh rate. It won't be able to compete with higher-end laptops in terms of brightness or HDR support. It's probably best to think of it like the low-cost <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, which offer excellent performance but uses much older display technology.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple could make the low-cost MacBook in bright colors like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> to appeal to children and to clearly position it as a lower-cost device. There are no rumors of this, but it would also make some sense for Apple to return to the plastic casing of some of its original MacBook models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRumors suggest the low-cost <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> could come in colors like silver, blue, pink, and yellow.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>A-Series Chip</h2>\r<br/>\nApple is planning to use its A18 Pro chip in the MacBook, which is a chip that was first used in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> Pro. The A18 Pro is built on Apple's second-generation 3-nanometer process, featuring 8GB RAM and support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt's fast and efficient, and more than capable of handling day-to-day tasks. In Geekbench 6 benchmarks, the A18 Pro offers single-core CPU performance scores at the level of the M3 Ultra, and multi-core performance scores higher than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip that Apple used in the first Apple silicon &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;. Metal scores that measure GPU performance are also similar to the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip Metal scores.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A18 Pro will be equivalent to the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; for some tasks, and faster for other tasks. Apple no longer sells the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; from its own store, but it has offered the machine through Walmart <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/macbook-air-with-m1-chip-599-at-walmart/\">at a &#36;599 price point</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Capabilities</h2>\r<br/>\nWith the A18 Pro chip, the low-cost MacBook would be able to do anything that can be done on an &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro. It would be a suitable replacement for the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; paired with a keyboard, and it would also support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs of now, an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is essentially the only option for a low-cost portable device that can serve as a computer, but the low-cost MacBook will add a solution that runs macOS instead of iPadOS.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTasks like browsing the web, watching videos, creating documents, editing photos, and even light video editing would be no problem. A low-cost MacBook with A18 Pro chip could play all of Apple's &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> games, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a> titles, but it would not work well with high-end system intensive games.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt would also likely run apps like Final Cut Pro, but speeds for things like exporting video would not be as quick as with a more powerful Mac.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple probably won't go all out on ports, and the MacBook is likely to get just a single USB-C port, though two like the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is also possible.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A18 Pro chip is efficient, and there's a lot of space inside a 13-inch enclosure for a battery, so we could be looking at MacBook Air-level battery life or better. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;'s battery lasts for up to 18 hours when watching videos, or 15 hours when browsing the web.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Price</h2>\r<br/>\nThere are no specific details on price as of yet, but <em>Bloomberg</em> claims it will cost \"well under &#36;1,000.\" The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;999, so the MacBook will need to be priced lower than that.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple has a 13-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> that has a display in the same range rumored for the low-cost MacBook, and it's priced at &#36;799. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; has a higher-end M-series processor though, so the low-cost MacBook could be priced below the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe closest &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; approximation for the chip is the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, which has an A17 Pro and is priced at &#36;499. A price somewhere between &#36;499 and &#36;799 could make sense looking at Apple's existing product lineup.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Launch Timing</h2>\r<br/>\nApple is expected to launch the low-cost MacBook in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/04/apple-budget-macbook-2026/\">first half of 2026</a>. Updates are planned for the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; in early 2026, and the low-cost model could launch sometime in that same timeframe.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf you're thinking about picking up a computer for lightweight tasks like document editing, web browsing, watching videos, and doing homework, you might want to wait to see what Apple has in store before buying a &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, or a more affordable Windows machine or Chromebook.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Read More</h2>\r<br/>\nFor more information on Apple's cheap MacBook, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/a18-pro-macbook/\">we have a dedicated guide</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/02/low-cost-macbook-pro-rumors/\">Apple&#039;s 2026 Low-Cost A18 Pro MacBook: What We Know So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-2026-low-cost-a18-pro-macbook-what-we-know-so-far.2475509/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

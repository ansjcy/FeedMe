      "content": "It's only been two months since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a> launched, but rumors don't take breaks. We're already hearing details about the next-generation iOS 27 update, which Apple will introduce in June 2026 before launching it in September 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/iOS-27-Mock-Quick.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028322\" />\r<br/>\nWe've rounded up all of the rumors that we've heard so far.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"foldable_features\">Foldable Features</h2>\r<br/>\nIn 2026, Apple plans to launch the first foldable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, a device that could be called the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold. Rumors suggest that it will feature a 5.5-inch display when folded, and a 7.8-inch display when it's opened up like a book.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAn &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a larger display that also folds will require some major updates to iOS, and iOS 27 will focus on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/21/ios-27-prioritize-foldable-iphone-features/\">building new interfaces</a> and experiences made for a larger display.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe haven't heard specifics on how Apple will tweak iOS to accommodate the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold, but we could see some iPad-like options such as side bars and perhaps even multitasking views with support for multiple windows.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"bug_fixes\">Bug Fixes</h2>\r<br/>\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/23/ios-27-two-key-upgrades/\">has described iOS 27</a> as a \"Snow Leopard\" update, suggesting that Apple will focus on improving underlying performance and quality rather than introducing major new functionality. Apple engineers are reportedly going through &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; to look for bloat, bugs, and any other issues impacting performance.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"liquid_glass\">Liquid Glass</h2>\r<br/>\niOS 27 might include refinements for the Liquid Glass design that Apple introduced with &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. There have already been some changes in the iOS 26.1 and iOS 26.2 updates, but iOS 27 will provide Apple with the opportunity to make larger adjustments.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"apple_intelligence\">Apple Intelligence</h2>\r<br/>\nWe're supposed to get the much smarter version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> in an iOS 26.4 update planned for spring 2026, but it's likely even more <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> capabilities will follow in iOS 27.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe don't know specifics yet, but &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features could expand to additional apps.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is working on a \"World Knowledge\" <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/03/llm-siri-with-search-early-2026/\">Siri search feature</a> that would provide information on general search queries, which will likely be included in &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s iOS 26.4 update. If it's not in iOS 26.4, the add-on &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; feature could instead come in iOS 27.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"siri\">Siri</h2>\r<br/>\nWith iOS 27, Apple could <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/siri-redesign-report/\">update Siri's design</a>. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will get its major overhaul in iOS 26.4, but a new visual look is supposedly planned for iOS 27. There are no specifics about what the redesign might entail, but rumors linked to Apple's upcoming tabletop robot suggest that the company <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-launching-robot-virtual-companion-in-2027/\">might introduce</a> a version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that's more animated, similar to the Mac Finder logo. That more animated version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; could also come to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"health+\">Health+</h2>\r<br/>\nApple is rumored to be developing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/24/apple-health-plus-rumored-to-launch-next-year/\">a paid Health+ service</a> with nutrition planning and medical suggestions, and we could see that introduced as part of iOS 27.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe medical tool would explain different health metrics and trends from the Health app, offering up personalized guidance for health improvement.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"new_satellite_features\">New Satellite Features</h2>\r<br/>\nApple is working on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/09/apple-developing-new-satellite-features/\">several new satellite features</a> for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and it's possible some features could be introduced as soon as 2027. Timing on Apple's satellite improvements is unclear, though, and behind-the-scenes updates from Apple's satellite partner Globalstar are required.\r<br/>\nRumored features:\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a> via satellite</li>\r<br/>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> in Messages via satellite</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Satellite API framework for third-party apps</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Satellite over 5G</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Satellite connectivity without the need for a view of the sky</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nSome of these features might require new hardware, but options like &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; via satellite would not require components beyond what's available now.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"launch_date\">Launch Date</h2>\r<br/>\nNew versions of iOS, macOS, and Apple's other software platforms will be previewed in June at WWDC before launching in September just ahead of when new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models come out.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-27-rumors/\">iOS 27: All the Rumors About Apple&#039;s Next Big iPhone Software Update</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-27-all-the-rumors-about-apples-next-big-iphone-software-update.2471988/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple is fighting an antitrust penalty law in India that could require it to pay massive fines in its ongoing antitrust dispute with Tinder owner Match, reports <em><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/apple-contests-indias-antitrust-penalty-law-with-risk-38-billion-fine-filing-2025-11-26/\">Reuters</a></em>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/apple-india.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2304\" height=\"1296\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-756076\" />\r<br/>\nLast year, India passed a law that allows the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to use global turnover when calculating penalties imposed on companies for abusing market dominance. Apple can be fined up to 10 percent, which would result in a penalty of around &#36;38 billion. Apple said that using global turnover would result in a fine that's \"manifestly arbitrary, unconstitutional, grossly disproportionate, and unjust.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is asking India's Delhi High Court to declare the law illegal, suggesting that penalties should be based on the Indian revenue of the specific unit that violates antitrust law.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple has been fighting an antitrust lawsuit in India since 2022 against dating app Match and several Indian startups. The CCI released a pair of reports last year suggesting that Apple <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/india-antitrust-probe-finds-apple-abused-position-apps-market-2024-07-12/\">had engaged in</a> \"abusive conduct and practices\" because it required developers to use its in-app purchase system. The CCI was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/apple-halts-indian-antitrust-probe-with-complaint/\">forced to recall</a> its investigative reports because they contained confidential information about Apple's business practices, resulting in a delay of several months. No final decision has been made, and a penalty has yet to be levied against Apple. Apple maintains that it has not done anything wrong, and argues that it has a very small share of the smartphone market in India because Android devices are much more popular.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple said in today's filing that the CCI used the new penalty law on November 10 in an unrelated case, fining a company for a violation that happened 10 years ago. Apple said it had \"no choice but to bring this constitutional challenge now\" to avoid having retrospective penalties applied against it, too.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMatch has argued that a high fine based on global turnover would discourage companies from repeating antitrust violations. Apple's plea will be heard on December 3.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/\">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/26/apple-india-antitrust-law-challenge/\">Apple Asks Indian Court to Block Antitrust Law Allowing &#36;38 Billion Fine</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-asks-indian-court-to-block-antitrust-law-allowing-38-billion-fine.2471983/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

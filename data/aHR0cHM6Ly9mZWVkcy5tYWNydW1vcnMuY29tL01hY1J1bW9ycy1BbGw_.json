While the executives typically do not break major news during these appearances, the lively conversations have offered some interesting insights and perspectives on various topics surrounding Apple's WWDC announcements.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/The-Talk-Show-Live-From-WWDC-2024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-955455\" />\r<br/>\nIn <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/29/the-talk-show-live-tickets-2025\">announcing ticket sales for this year's live episode going live</a> today, Gruber has revealed that Apple declined his invitation for executives to appear on this year's episode, for the first time in the decade of this tradition.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGruber did not share a reason for Apple declining this year's invitation, and Apple likely did not provide one to him, but it's easy to surmise that it was probably due to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/gruber-says-something-is-rotten-at-apple/\">Gruber's recent comments sharing his belief that \"Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino\"</a> in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> delays.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn his March blog post, Gruber faulted himself for not seeing the \"red flags\" that were appearing as early as last year's WWDC, with Apple apparently showing off planned &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features that were not actually functional at the time and some of which may not even yet be functional.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHe faulted Apple for showing off what amounted to vaporware at last year's WWDC, a significant departure from Apple's history over the past several decades of almost always shipping features close to their suggested timelines even when they have been pre-announced before they are fully ready.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGruber's comments were notable given his status as one of the most well-known Apple pundits, not to mention the fact that Apple had chosen him to be the one to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/\">share the news days earlier</a> that the Apple Intelligence-powered &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; revamp had been delayed.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt's hard not to view Apple's move as a form of retribution for Gruber's criticism, and also potentially an acknowledgement that Gruber would be liable to ask Apple executives some difficult questions about what occurred to force the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; delay and where things go from here.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/29/no-apple-executives-talk-show-live/\">Apple Executives Won&#039;t Be Appearing at This Year&#039;s WWDC Episode of The Talk Show Live</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-executives-wont-be-appearing-at-this-years-wwdc-episode-of-the-talk-show-live.2457908/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "With the next-generation version of iOS and other 2025 software updates, Apple is planning to change its numbering scheme. Rather than iOS 19, which would logically follow <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, Apple is instead going to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/\">call the update iOS 26</a>. Apple plans to use 26 across all of its platforms (the number representing the upcoming year), which will presumably be less confusing than having iOS 19, macOS 16, watchOS 12, and visionOS 3. But what does the change mean for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iOS-26-Mock-Rainbow-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003293\" />\r<br/>\nIf Apple is looking to streamline naming, it could make sense for future &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models to follow the same year-based numbering. An &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 26 or &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 26 Pro that launches with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 26</a> would be more logical than an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> that runs &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, at least until that &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 26 needs to be updated to iOS 27 or iOS 28.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYear-based numbering for iPhones would make it clear to consumers when an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; came out. The average &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user that doesn't upgrade on the regular probably can't tell you the year that their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; launched, because there's no obvious link between the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 and 2022, or the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> and 2024.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple may already have a naming conundrum in the works where some kind of transition will make sense. This year, we're on track to get the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;. In 2026, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18, and in 2027, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 19. But 2027 is the 20th anniversary of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, so will Apple want its 20th anniversary device to be the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 19? Apple didn't make that choice in 2017 at the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s 10th anniversary, and we never ended up with a &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 9 because we got the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X instead.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple uses year-based numbering for its Macs, though not overtly. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> is just the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, but when you're looking for tech specs or comparison info on Apple's site, you'll find that the latest model <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/122209\">is in fact</a> the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; (M4, 2025). iPhones could also just be \"&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;\" and appended in the same way.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere is a disconnect in Mac naming and the way Apple is doing software update naming going forward, though. Macs are named for the year they're released, but iOS and its sister updates are going to be named for the coming year on launch. &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; in September 2025, iOS 27 in September 2026, iOS 28 in September 2027, and so on. Mac-like numbering for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; would be the sensible choice instead of the year-ahead numbering, but it's doubtful that Apple will want to launch an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; (2025) running &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple could also go with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> numbering for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in the future. iPads aren't named like iPhones, and have historically used generations. The low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, for example, was the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; (5th generation) and then (6th generation) and (7th generation) and so on. More recently, Apple is using chips to differentiate between different generations of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. So there's the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, and the M3 &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, along with the A16 &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; (11th generation) and the A17 Pro <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>. Chip-based naming probably won't work for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; like it does for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and some Macs because there are multiple iPhones that use the same chip. Apple would need to do something like &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; (A19), &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air (A19), &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Pro (A19), and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Pro Max (A19), which is no better for marketing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple might not change &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; numbering at all, given that naming across iPads, Macs, iPhones, and other devices has never exactly been straightforward. Whether Apple intends to streamline device names going forward may become clearer at the June 9 Worldwide Developers Conference. We'll hear about the plan to go from &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; at the keynote event, and the way that Apple frames it might just provide some insight into whether we can expect a similar change for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to match.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/29/will-apple-rename-iphones-ios-26/\">With iOS 18 Jumping to iOS 26, Will Apple Renumber iPhones Too?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/with-ios-18-jumping-to-ios-26-will-apple-renumber-iphones-too.2457896/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Display analyst Ross Young today <a href=\"https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1928146088097349832\">reiterated the screen sizes</a> expected for the entire &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; lineup, and it serves as a good reminder about what to expect from Apple's lowest-priced flagship.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; will feature a larger 6.27-inch display, which will make it the same size as the current <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> display. With the 16 Pro and Pro Max, Apple introduced larger displays, while the 16 and 16 Plus stayed the same size as the 15 and 15 Plus.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li>&zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; - 6.27-inch display, up from 6.12 inches.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>&zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; - 6.55 inches.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a> - 6.27-inch display, identical to &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>&zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max - 6.86-inch display, no change from &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nApple rounds 6.27 to 6.3 inches and 6.86 to 6.9 inches, so basically, we're going to get an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; that are 6.3 inches, and the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max at 6.9 inches. The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; has a new display size that Apple will likely round to 6.6 inches. It will be slightly smaller than the 6.7-inch display of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> Plus it replaces.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAside from that new display size, the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; is shaping up to be the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> with the fewest changes in 2025. The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models and the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; are rumored to have a new horizontal rear camera bar, but the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; camera will look the same as the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; camera.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are features to look forward to though, such as the 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate that's rumored to be expanding to the entire &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; lineup, an improved 24-megapixel selfie camera, and a faster A19 chip.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/29/iphone-17-display-sizes/\">iPhone 17 Display Sizes: What to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-display-sizes-what-to-expect.2457893/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "I've taken a look at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/alogic-clarity-pro-touch-displays/\">several of Alogic's 4K displays</a> over the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/alogic-clarity-max-touch-display/\">past couple of years</a>, but the company has taken things to the next level with its new 27-inch Clarity 5K Touch display. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/alogic-5k-touchscreen-display/\">Announced nearly a year ago</a>, the <a href=\"https://alogic.co/products/clarity-5k-touch-uhd-monitor-with-usb-c-power-delivery-and-touch-screen/?ref=y2uwzwu\">Clarity 5K Touch recently began shipping</a> to deliver not only a high-quality display experience with sufficient pixel density of 218 pixels per inch for full Retina support, but also touchscreen functionality via both stylus and fingers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/alogic-clarity-5k-touch-mbp.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003432\" />\r<br/>\nI've been testing out the Clarity 5K Touch for a few weeks, and I've come away impressed with the display quality and overall functionality, though the regular &#36;1,600 price tag may give some potential customers pause when weighing it against other non-Apple 5K display options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlogic's Clarity 5K Touch offers a resolution of 5120 × 2880, and packing that many pixels into a 27-inch display means it can show a 2560 × 1440 HiDPI desktop in excellent true Retina quality at typical viewing distances. This yields crisp text and graphics without potential performance penalties and visual artifacts that can result from non-pixel-perfect scaling at lower pixel densities.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDisplay quality on the Clarity 5K Touch was excellent in my testing, essentially indistinguishable from my <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> (aside from ProMotion support) or my usual LG UltraFine 5K external displays running in Retina mode. Text and images appear super-sharp on the display, with individual pixels not visible until I get quite close to the display, as you'd expect at this pixel density. The display offers a 1,000:1 contrast ratio and up to 400 nits of typical brightness, which is a bit lower than Apple's notebooks and the Studio Display which can offer 500–600 nits of typical SDR brightness indoors, but the Clarity 5K Touch was plenty bright enough in my workspace.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/alogic-clarity-5k-touch-closeup.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003433\" />\r<br/>\nColor calibration appeared excellent out of the box, with everything looking vibrant yet natural and closely matching the other displays in my setup. The Clarity 5K Touch supports 100% of the sRGB gamut and 99% of the Adobe RGB and DCI-P3 gamuts, and it features HDR400 support.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Clarity 5K Touch is a glossy display, and while Alogic says it features an anti-reflective finish, the glossiness is very evident if you use it in an environment where there is any significant amount of glare such as direct lighting or nearby windows. Depending on the relative locations and angles of those lighting sources and your seating position, the glare can interfere with visibility at times, so that's something to be aware of as you consider where you're planning to use the display.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/alogic-clarity-5k-touch-stand.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003436\" />\r<br/>\nThe display's construction feels solid, with the stand made primarily of silver aluminum for good heft and stability. A hole in the stand neck helps route cables to minimize their visibility. In addition to adjustable height over a range of 145 mm, the Clarity 5K Touch also supports tilt (5º forward to 20º back), swivel (up to 25º left or right), and pivot adjustments for maximum flexibility. You can pivot the display all the way to 90 degrees if you prefer to use the display in portrait orientation, while tilt and swivel help you get the display in just the right position, which is especially helpful in trying to mitigate glare. Support for 100×100 VESA mounts is also included if you prefer a different mounting solution.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe display body features a silver plastic enclosure on the rear with ventilation holes toward the top and bottom, which is perfectly adequate in my opinion considering I'm hardly ever going to look at the rear of it. Even so, it's a simple and clean design, just without the high-quality aluminum you'd find on an Apple display.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAround the screen itself, the black bezels aren't the thinnest I've encountered, with uniform size around the top and sides and a slightly chunkier bottom bezel, some of which no doubt going toward housing the touchscreen hardware. The bezels are essentially entirely underneath the display glass aside from a very narrow plastic strip around the perimeter, which does help hide them a bit, especially if using a dark desktop and/or dark mode.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/alogic-clarity-5k-touch-rear.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003434\" />\r<br/>\nOne area where the Clarity 5K Touch tops the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/\">Apple Studio Display</a> is in the connectivity department, with Alogic's display offering not only a USB-C connection option but also a pair of HDMI 2.0 ports and a DisplayPort 1.4 port, allowing you to hook up multiple devices and easily switch the display between them or even show multiple sources simultaneously with picture-in-picture modes. The USB-C and DisplayPort ports support up to 5K resolution at 60 Hz, while the HDMI ports support up to 5K resolution at 30 Hz, so while you're not going to get the sharpest gaming response out of this display, I've found it to be perfectly acceptable for less demanding daily work.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/alogic-clarity-5k-touch-ports.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003435\" />\r<br/>\nOther than some resolution and orientation options managed through the Settings app on your Mac, the various inputs and other display settings are handled through an on-screen display menu system, which is a bit lacking in the visuals department as is par for the course on these types of controls. Buttons hidden along the bottom right edge of the display allow you to move through the various settings, and you'll need to use these buttons to adjust speaker volume and display brightness, as native Mac keyboard control for these is not supported.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn addition to those various connectivity options for display sources, the Clarity 5K Touch also includes a USB-B 3.0 port for upstream data, and the display includes a pair of USB-A 3.0 ports (5 Gbps data, 7.5W charging) to serve as a hub for connecting wired accessories as long as there is either a USB-C or USB-B connection to the computer to facilitate data transfer. There's also a 3.5mm audio jack for connecting headphones or a speaker system, though it is output-only, so microphone input is not supported.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen connected over USB-C, the Clarity 5K Touch can support up to 65 watts of charging to a connected computer, but this drops to 45 watts when the display is in HDR mode. That's enough to keep something like a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, or potentially even a 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, charged up, but it may not be able to keep up if you start getting into demanding workflows on more powerful machines, especially on a 16-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;. And you certainly won't be able to fast charge a depleted &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; battery via the display. That said, it was able to keep up with my 16- inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; just fine in daily work.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThen there are the unique touchscreen capabilities of the Clarity 5K Touch, as Alogic claims it's the world's first 5K touchscreen display and we've yet to see anything to dispute this among the small number of 27-inch 5K displays on the market. I've already covered much of this functionality in my reviews of Alogic's earlier 4K touchscreen display, and the idea remains essentially the same here.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nInstall a Mac driver from the <a href=\"https://alogic.co/products/clarity-5k-touch-uhd-monitor-with-usb-c-power-delivery-and-touch-screen/?ref=y2uwzwu\">Alogic product page</a> (Windows machines should support the functionality out of the box) and grant the appropriate permissions, and you'll be able to interact with macOS via up to 5-point multitouch or any active stylus supporting Microsoft Pen Protocol (MPP) 2.0, such as <a href=\"https://alogic.co/products/clarity-active-stylus-pen/?ref=y2uwzwu\">Alogic's Clarity Active Stylus Pen</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/alogic-updd-commander-settings.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1618\" height=\"1448\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003431\" />\r<br/>\nThe UPDD Commander app provided as part of the driver installation isn't the prettiest Mac app you'll ever see, but it offers an array of customization settings to help optimize the touchscreen experience, including setting up functions for a wide variety of tap, press, swipe, and drag gestures with varying numbers of fingers. For example, you can set up a one-finger tap as a traditional mouse click and a two-finger tap as a right click, swipes in various locations can do things like show or hide the Dock, invoke Mission Control, or minimize windows. Two-finger rotation and pinch gestures can also be configured to manipulate on-screen content, and you can even set up different actions for gestures depending on which app you're in.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs with my previous reviews of this family of displays, I still find the touch functionality to be more appropriately used as a secondary input method, as it is not very efficient (not to mention tiring on the arm) to try to use touch input as a full-time control and it is a bit clunky to be constantly shifting from mouse to keyboard to touch. So if you're looking to turn your Mac, into a full touch experience, you'll likely be disappointed.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThat's not to say the functionality doesn't come in handy though, and the most useful scenario for touch input in my opinion is in a multi-display setup where the Clarity 5K Touch serves as a secondary monitor. I keep Mail, Slack, and a few other apps perpetually open on a display off to the side of my main display, and it's nice to be able to reach over and quickly tap or swipe to look at emails or scroll through my feeds without having to move my mouse cursor back and forth across multiple displays. Everyone's situation is different, however, so consider how you might use a touch-capable display in both your workflow and your physical setup.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe glossy display will pick up fingerprints over time as you touch it, but it's generally not a big deal as you long as you keep the glare of bright lighting away from the screen. Otherwise, an occasional wipe down with a microfiber cloth cleans it right up.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe built-in 5-watt speakers provide a good amount of volume and provide a surprisingly immersive sound that I think comes from their rearward-firing orientation reflecting off the wall behind my desk, though overall the sound is a bit hollow as is common with integrated display speakers housed in plastic enclosures.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Clarity 5K Touch does not include a built-in webcam, but Alogic does sell an <a href=\"https://alogic.co/products/illuminate-usb-c-light-bar-with-4k-webcam/?ref=y2uwzwu\">illuminated light bar</a> with 12-megapixel 4K autofocus webcam that connects via USB-C and features touch controls and a magnetic remote control dial to help light up your workspace.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://alogic.co/products/clarity-5k-touch-uhd-monitor-with-usb-c-power-delivery-and-touch-screen/?ref=y2uwzwu\">Clarity 5K Touch</a> is normally priced at &#36;1,599.99, though it's currently on sale for 10% off, bringing the price down to &#36;1,439.99. That's just a bit cheaper than the starting price of Apple's Studio Display, though Alogic does give you a much more adjustable stand at no additional charge.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnd while Alogic's display lacks the tight macOS integration and built-in webcam found on the &zwnj;Apple Studio Display&zwnj;, Alogic of course delivers the unique touchscreen functionality, so that will likely be a major consideration for potential customers. If you think the touchscreen functionality might be useful, then the Clarity 5K Touch is your only option currently on the market. If not, you might want to consider the &zwnj;Apple Studio Display&zwnj; or potentially one of the few other 27-inch 5K displays that are currently available at sometimes significantly lower prices.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<small><em>Note: Alogic provided MacRumors with the Clarity 5K Touch display for the purposes of this review.

Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-releases-ios-26-2-1/\">released iOS 26.2.1</a> last week with support for the AirTags 2.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/iOS-26.2.1-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031813\" />\r<br/>\nSoftware \"signing\" means that it has passed the server-side verification check that Apple performs when a user downloads a new version of iOS on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.

Until today, users would have been able to downgrade from iOS 26.2.1 to iOS 26.2 if desired for some reason.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUnsigning software prevents Apple customers from installing outdated, less secure versions of iOS, and Apple typically stops signing an update a week or so after new software comes out.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple has also stopped signing several older versions of iOS provided for devices unable to update to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, including iOS 12.5.7, iOS 15.8.5, iOS 16.7.12, and iOS 18.7.3. iOS 12.5.8, iOS 15.8.6, and iOS 18.7.4 were released last week, while an updated version of iOS 16 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/02/apple-releases-ios-16-7-14/\">came out today</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/02/apple-stops-signing-ios-26-2/\">Apple Stops Signing iOS 26.2, Blocking Downgrades From iOS 26.2.1</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-26-2-blocking-downgrades-from-ios-26-2-1.2477078/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple just released the second-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airtag/\">AirTag</a>, five years after the original model debuted. There's been a lot of time for Apple to come up with improvements, so we thought we'd test out the new model to see what's changed, and whether it's worth upgrading from the first-generation &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5O5ImaEBH2g\" title=\"AirTag 2 Hands-On: Better Precision Finding and Apple Watch Support!\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br/>\nUnfortunately, Apple didn't update the design of the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2, so it looks almost identical to the original model. The only thing that's changed is the text on the back, which is now in caps and includes wording about the IP67 waterproofing, and that doesn't count as any kind of design change.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt would have been nice to have different design options or a rechargeable battery, but the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; is the same coin shape and it still uses CR2032 batteries. Apple didn't mention anything about battery life improvements, so the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2 still lasts about a year before you need to swap it out.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile there aren't external updates, Apple did boost connectivity. The &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2 uses an upgraded version of Bluetooth and it has a second-generation Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip, so it can be tracked from further away over Bluetooth, and the close-range Precision Finding feature works over longer distances.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAccording to Apple, Precision Finding works from up to 50 percent further away, so when you lose your &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; indoors or are close to it, a UWB-enabled <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> (the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 and later) can lead you right to it. Apple also enabled Precision Finding on the Apple Watch Series 9 and later and the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and later, which is super useful. You can't use an Apple Watch to locate an original &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; nearby, and it's probably the best addition to the second-generation version.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYou can even add a quick access toggle for Precision Finding to the Apple Watch for instant access to tracking down an &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; without digging through menus. It's a much more natural way to find your items.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn our testing, Precision Finding on the Apple Watch worked reliably, tracking down an &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; indoors even with walls and furniture in the way. The interface is the same as the Precision Finding interface on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, just scaled down to an Apple Watch size. You'll get a directional arrow and distance to help you accurately track down the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen pitting the original &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; against the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2 with &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Precision Finding, the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2 was clearly superior. Both AirTags were tucked inside a backpack, and placed out of line of sight.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe original &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; had a hard time with walls and objects, and required us to be closer to the backpack to get a connection. The &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2 picked up signal from much further away, and kept the signal as we walked toward the backpack. It even worked with the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2 on a different floor, and kept its connection in a large office building.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple also updated the internals of the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2 to upgrade the sound, and it is noticeably louder. It is a pretty big improvement in audibility, and you will notice the difference between the two. The sound is sharper and easier to pinpoint, and it is much less likely to blend into background noise. It makes it easier to find items, but it also improves the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2's anti-stalking capabilities. It's harder to tuck an &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; away and mute its sound, and Apple also made the speaker module more difficult to remove with additional adhesive.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2 is still priced at &#36;29, with Apple offering a pack of four for &#36;99, so it's a solid deal, especially with the tracking improvements. For most people, it's probably not worth upgrading to an &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; 2 if you already have an original &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj;, but if you're someone that heavily relies on AirTags on a regular basis, it could be a good idea to pick up a couple of the second-generation versions.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airtag/\">AirTag</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/02/airtag-2-review/\">AirTag 2 Hands-On: What&#039;s New and Should You Upgrade?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airtag-2-hands-on-whats-new-and-should-you-upgrade.2477070/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Anker today launched its latest charger for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0FHWK3W1S\">Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station</a>. It's a 3-in-1 charger that can charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; at up to 25W, fast charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and charge AirPods, too.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/anker-ptime-charging-station-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2363\" height=\"1329\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034907\" />\r<br/>\nThe Prime Wireless Charging Station features Qi2.2 support, which lets a compatible <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; charge at up to 25W. It's the same speed as Apple's &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger, and it is 10W faster than the standard Qi2 &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; chargers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> models are able to fast charge with the Prime Wireless Charging Station, and can get up to a 50 percent charge within 30 minutes. We were able to test the Prime Wireless Charging Station ahead of launch, and it did indeed charge an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a> Max from dead to 46 percent in a 30-minute period as promised. Wireless charging speeds can vary based on charge level, temperature, and other factors, but the Prime Wireless Charging Station is able to match Apple's native &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCharging speeds are steady thanks to an active \"AirCool\" feature that keeps the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; cool while it's charging. It's meant to ensure the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is below 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit while it's on the charger, and the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max did feel slightly cooler than when charging with a standard &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger. The included cooling system is close to inaudible with a tiny fan embedded at the back and a vent at the top, so it's suitable for use on a nightstand or desktop.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/anker-prime-charging-station-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034908\" />\r<br/>\nIt's not clear if the active cooling makes a major difference in all circumstances since we have also been able to get a similar charge in a similar time period with Apple's &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger, but it could be a useful feature in hotter conditions. The room we tested in was around 68F, while Anker's testing conditions were at 77F. Anker's site suggests the active cooling allows an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; to charge 24 percent faster with 30 percent less heat buildup. Anker says the cooling option is also meant to preserve battery health and maintain safety, which is worth considering.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple Watches that support fast charging are able to charge at maximum speed, and there is enough power for the AirPods or AirPods Pro. There is a tappable LED for controlling the AirCool feature, which you can tap to turn it on or off. The LED turns blue when the AirCool feature is on, or white when it's off. It'll also turn orange if you connect an incompatible adapter that's below 45W, which is helpful. If you're wanting to use the Prime Wireless Charging Station on your nightstand, you'll be glad to hear that the LEDs turn off after a few seconds so there is no annoying light at night.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Prime Wireless Charging Station takes up minimal space, thanks to a folding design. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; charges in an upright position with support for StandBy mode, while the pop-up Apple Watch charger is positioned behind with the AirPods charging platform underneath. The Apple Watch charger folds down into the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; charger with a hinge that feels durable, and you can press to pop it out. For charging the AirPods, there is an anti-slip pad that has a little AirPods icon for ideal alignment.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/anker-prime-charging-station-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1797\" height=\"1011\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034909\" />\r<br/>\nThe whole thing folds down into a small, palm-sized package that's ideal for travel, measuring in at 3.8 inches by 2.4 inches by 1.2 inches. It's surprisingly light for what it is, similar in weight to the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max that we tested it with. You can use the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; charger with the Charging Station folded up, but you'll need to open it all the way to get to the Apple Watch and AirPods chargers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; charging portion works as a stand, and you can change the angle from 0 to 60 degrees without the weight of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; collapsing it down. It works well for watching videos or for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> calls.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnker includes a 45W power adapter that's needed to get the maximum charging speeds, along with a standard 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cable, which means the charger is ready to go out of the box. It would have been nice to have an integrated cable of some kind to really boost the travel-friendly design, but it's still a compact design that's easy to tuck into a backpack or suitcase. It also looks slick with a gray aluminum design, black magnetic charging surface for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and AirPods, and matching stabilizing feet at the bottom. The Apple Watch charger is a Made for Apple Watch design, so it's in white.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnker's charger is designed for the latest &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models, but it is backwards compatible with all &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, and it also works with all Apple Watch models and all AirPods models. As with all magnetic chargers, if you want to use the charging station with an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; case, you'll need a MagSafe-compatible case.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Prime Wireless Charging Station can be <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0FHWK3W1S\">purchased from Amazon</a> or from <a href=\"https://www.anker.com/products/a25n1-anker-prime-qi2-25w-foldable-3-in-1-wireless-charger\">the Anker website</a> for &#36;120 thanks to a 20 percent launch discount.

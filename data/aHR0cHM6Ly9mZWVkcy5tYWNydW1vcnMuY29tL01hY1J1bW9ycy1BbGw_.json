      "content": "You'd think things would be slowing down heading into the holidays, but this week saw a whirlwind of Apple leaks and rumors while Apple started its next cycle of betas following last week's release of iOS 26.2 and related updates.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/top-stories-2025-12-20.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030670\" />\r<br/>\nThis week also saw the release of a new Apple Music integration with ChatGPT, so read on below for all the details on this week's biggest stories!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Top Stories</h2>\r<br/>\n<h3>iOS 26.3 Beta 1 Features: What's New So Far</h3>\r<br/>\nWith iOS 26.2 and other 26.2 updates now available to the general public, Apple has started beta testing on the next round of 26.3 updates. With work on this round of updates typically spanning the holidays, they tend to be smaller in scale, but there are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/ios-26-3-beta-1-features/\">still a few notable changes</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/iOS-26.3-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029939\" />\r<br/>\niOS 26.3 brings changes that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/ios-26-3-iphone-android-transfer-tool/\">make it easier to switch from iPhone to Android</a>, with corresponding changes to Android making the reverse process simpler as well. Users in the European Union will also be gaining a setting that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/ios-26-3-notification-forwarding/\">allows iPhone notifications to be forwarded to third-party devices</a>, increasing interoperability.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>iOS 26.4 and iOS 27 Features Revealed in New Leak</h3>\r<br/>\n<em>Macworld</em>'s Filipe Espósito last week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/12/alleged-ios-26-4-and-ios-27-features/\">revealed a handful of features that Apple is allegedly planning for iOS 26.4, iOS 27, and even iOS 28</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/iOS-26.4-and-27-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029934\" />\r<br/>\nAs always, Apple's plans could change, so there is no guarantee that any or all of these features will end up being released to the general public, but some of the leaked features include:\r<br/>\n<ul><li>iOS 26.4: Revamped Siri powered by Apple Intelligence</li>\r<br/>\n<li>iOS 26.4: Redesigned Health app, potentially involving a previously rumored Apple Health+ subscription service</li>\r<br/>\n<li>iOS 26.4: Credit card AutoFill improvements for third-party apps</li>\r<br/>\n<li>iOS 27: Improvements to collections in the Photos app and AirPods pairing</li>\r<br/>\n<li>iOS 28: New metrics for Apple Watch sleep tracking</li></ul>\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Leak Confirms Work on Foldable iPhone, AirTag 2, and Dozens More Devices</h3>\r<br/>\nMore information on the sourcing of that software leak has subsequently surfaced, and it apparently comes from an early build of iOS 26 (then still known as iOS 19) that was on a leaked prototype iPhone.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/apple-beta-26-lineup.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005210\" />\r<br/>\nIn addition to numerous features planned for future software updates, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/ios-software-leak-apple-features/\">which we've outlined in more detail</a>, the leak also reveals <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/apple-leak-unreleased-devices-codenames/\">dozens of devices in Apple's product pipeline</a>, including many of the expected evolutionary updates to existing products but also some new products that have either been previously rumored or newly revealed.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNotable additions include the first foldable iPhone, Apple's upcoming smart home products, the rumored low-cost MacBook powered by an A18 Pro chip, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/apple-developing-imac-with-m5-max/\">iMac with a high-powered M5 Max chip</a>, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Aims to Boost Popularity of iPhone Air 2 in Two Ways</h3>\r<br/>\nA new report this week from <em>The Information</em> outlined some details on Apple's iPhone product roadmap, including word that Apple is looking at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/iphone-air-2-two-rumored-changes/\">two key improvements for the second-generation iPhone Air: a second rear camera and a lower price tag</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iphone-air-silver.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018105\" />\r<br/>\nThe current iPhone Air has reportedly not sold well due to compromises related to camera capabilities, battery life, and perceived value for the price, with suppliers reportedly already winding down production due to the number of already-produced units still available for distribution.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe same report claimed that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/iphone-18-pro-features-report/\">next year's iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max will include under-screen Face ID</a> with the front camera becoming a punch hole at the top-left corner of the screen. Apple is reportedly also adding a mechanical iris to one of the device's rear cameras, which will allow for variable aperture to control the amount of light reaching the sensor.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Leak Reveals Foldable iPhone Details</h3>\r<br/>\nWe've already heard a lot about Apple's first foldable iPhone that's expected next year, but a new report from a frequent leaker on Chinese blogging site Weibo has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/leak-reveals-foldable-iphone-details/\">added a few new details to the existing rumors</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/iphone-fold-text.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029302\" />\r<br/>\nThe foldable iPhone will reportedly use a Touch ID power button on the side of the device rather than Face ID in order to save internal space, and it will include a 7.58-inch internal display with an under-screen camera. When folded, the outside will feature a 5.25-inch display with a punch-hole camera.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>ChatGPT's Apple Music Integration Is Now Live</h3>\r<br/>\nThere's now a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/17/chatgpt-apple-music-integration/\">dedicated Apple Music app for ChatGPT</a>, which allows ChatGPT to make music recommendations and build playlists.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/apple-music-chatgpt.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030496\" />\r<br/>\nChatGPT can be used to search through the ‌Apple Music‌ catalog for songs, artists, albums, and playlists, even without an ‌Apple Music‌ subscription. OpenAI says that all users are able to discover music, generate playlists, and listen to preview clips in ChatGPT. ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers can add songs, albums, and playlists to their ‌Apple Music‌ Library using ChatGPT.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>MacRumors Newsletter</h2>\r<br/>\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/dec-18-2025\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/20/top-stories-ios-26-3-beta/\">Top Stories: iOS 26.3 Beta, Major Apple Leaks, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-ios-26-3-beta-major-apple-leaks-and-more.2475010/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple's Beats brand is launching a new celebrity ad campaign today featuring rapper Travis Scott and entitled \"DARE TO DREAM.\" The campaign is inspired by a 2011 tweet from Scott when he was just starting his career, in which he claimed, \"One day Travis Scott will be somebody.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHYXwUkpGh0?si=4OAQcWIXgYpvo_aI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r<br/>\nThe campaign short film is a \"testament to how belief in oneself can manifest into reality\" and features a re-creation of his actual childhood bedroom and an appearance by his real mother, Wanda Webster.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe film depicts a young Scott working on music projects using his <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> and the original Beats Studio headphones, with the scene transforming from his bedroom to a dream of sold-out shows on his just-completed \"Circus Maximus\" tour spanning multiple legs over the past two years.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/beats-travis-scott-be-somebody.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030718\" />\r<br/>\nThe dream is short-lived, however, with his mother calling him back to reality and sending him off to school. Inspired by the dream, Scott composes his prophetic tweet, and on his way out of the house he discovers a pair of Powerbeats Fit in his pocket, a symbol linking past and present.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile the partnership with Scott is currently focused on the campaign film, Beats Chief Marketing Officer Chris Thorne hints that we can expect to see more in the future.<blockquote>“This campaign captures something deeply personal — the belief that greatness starts with a single idea and the courage to chase it,” said Chris Thorne, Beats CMO. “It’s the same belief that connects Beats and Travis — and this is only the beginning of what we’ll build together.”</blockquote>Whether this means we'll see any product partnerships between Beats and Scott down the road remains to be seen.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/travis-scott/\">Travis Scott</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/19/beats-travis-scott-campaign/\">Beats Launches Travis Scott Partnership Featuring New &#039;DARE TO DREAM&#039; Ad Campaign</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beats-launches-travis-scott-partnership-featuring-new-dare-to-dream-ad-campaign.2474992/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Since the beginning of December, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/02/apple-pushes-ios-18-users-to-ios-26/\">has been pushing</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users who opted to stay on iOS 18 to install <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a> instead. Apple started by making the iOS 18 upgrades less visible, and has now transitioned to making new iOS 18 updates unavailable on any device capable of running &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/ios-18-security-update.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030704\" />\r<br/>\nIf you have an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 or later, Apple is no longer offering new versions of iOS 18, even though there was a security update that came out alongside iOS 26.2. Apple stopped showing new iOS 18 updates <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/12/apple-releases-ios-26-2/\">when iOS 26.2 launched</a>, forcing iOS 18 users to upgrade to iOS 26.2 if they want to keep their devices secure.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor now, there's a way to stay on iOS 18 and continue to get security updates. On a device running iOS 18, you can turn on iOS 18 public beta updates to force new versions of iOS 18 to show up. This may not remain an option for long, but it works at the current time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's move to push users to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; is timed with a long list of security updates introduced in iOS 26.2 and iOS 18.7.3, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/12/ios-26-2-security-vulnerabilities/\">a WebKit vulnerability</a> known to be actively exploited. Both updates addressed the problem, so there is no technical need for the iOS 26.2 requirement.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nJason Snell <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/12/apple-is-forcing-iphones-to-update-to-ios-26-to-patch-security-holes/\">wrote an article yesterday</a> on Apple's decision not to offer iOS 18 users further iOS 18 upgrades and speculated that it might be a bug or an error, but the reality is that Apple does this every year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-wont-make-you-upgrade-to-ios-15/\">iOS 14 to iOS 15 transition</a> in 2021 was the first time that Apple allowed users to remain on an older version of iOS. At the time, Apple said that iOS offered \"a choice between two software update versions.\" Users would be able to update to iOS 15 at release, or opt to continue on iOS 14 and \"still get important security updates.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs promised, Apple <em>did</em> allow users to stay on iOS 14 and avoid the iOS 15 update, but only temporarily. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/13/apple-pushing-ios-14-users-upgrade-ios-15/\">started pushing people</a> to iOS 15 in January 2022 by making the iOS 15 software update option more prominent and no longer offering iOS 14 security updates for devices capable of running iOS 15.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn fact, iOS 14 updates stopped being available when Apple launched iOS 15.2, which might sound familiar because it is the exact same path that it followed with the iOS 18 to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; transition. Apple did the same thing with the iOS 16 to iOS 17 transition, and the iOS 17 to iOS 18 transition.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor a clear answer why iOS 18 security updates are no longer available on devices capable of running &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, we can <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/19/ios-14-option-temporary-apple/\">look to what Apple had to say</a> in 2022 after people complained about being forced to upgrade to iOS 15. According to Apple, the option for users to stay on iOS 14 and avoid iOS 15 was always meant to be temporary. Apple provided a grace period for people to remain on iOS 14 while iOS 15 bugs were worked out, but Apple ultimately wanted users on the latest version of iOS.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn a support document published in 2021, Apple clarified that users would be able to stay on the old version of iOS \"for a period of time,\" but not forever.\r<br/>\n<blockquote>If you're using iOS or iPadOS 14.5 or later, you might now see the option to choose between two software update versions. This option allows you to choose between updating to the latest version of iOS or iPadOS 15 as soon as it's released, or continuing on iOS or iPadOS 14 while still getting important security updates for a period of time.</blockquote>\r<br/>\nApple has continued with the same update policy since iOS 15, but the company's move to wean users off of iOS 18 is more visible this year due to the design changes introduced with &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. Liquid Glass is a major user interface overhaul that's polarizing, and some users are unsurprisingly reluctant to update for that reason.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>Update:</b> Apple is no longer allowing the iOS 18 public beta to be used to skirt the iOS 18 to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; transition. Opting in to the iOS 18 beta no longer triggers the iOS 18.7.3 update. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/19/ios-18-forced-ios-26-upgrade/\">Don&#039;t Want to Upgrade to iOS 26?

The technology that Astropad is using cuts reflections by 75 percent, while improving contrast and keeping colors vibrant. Unlike other anti-reflective screen protectors, there's no haze or distortion.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-comparison-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030688\" />\r<br/>\nPriced at &#36;30, Fresh Coat is made from a scratch-proof tempered glass that also provides protection for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display in addition to cutting down on glare and reflections. It's slim and won't add any bulk to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; even though it has a five-layer design. From the top down, there's an anti-reflective coating, an oleophobic and hydrophobic coating, a layer of tempered glass, a dust barrier, and an impact-resistant \"airbag\" bonding.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-layers.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030684\" />\r<br/>\nIf you have an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, it comes with a new anti-reflective coating added by Apple. What you might not know, though, is that you can't use just any screen protector with the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;. If you put a regular screen protector without an anti-reflective coating on, it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/04/iphone-17-screen-protector-anti-reflective-issue/\">entirely nullifies</a> the anti-reflective properties of that added coating.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-comparison-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030685\" />\r<br/>\nSince Fresh Coat has its own anti-reflective coating, it actually improves upon Apple's included anti-reflective layer, reducing glare even further. With Fresh Coat, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s screen is easy to see in any lighting conditions, there's less eye strain, and if you use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/\">Dark Mode</a>, it looks even darker.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-description.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030686\" />\r<br/>\nIf you don't have an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, Fresh Coat can provide an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17-style display upgrade, mirroring Apple's own reflection-reducing display coating. Fresh Coat is available for all &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> Pro and Pro Max, and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 15 Pro and Pro Max.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-comparison-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030687\" />\r<br/>\nAstropad even designed an installation process that's impossible to mess up, so you get perfect alignment on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; without hassle.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe have an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; in white and a Fresh Coat screen protector for one lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader.

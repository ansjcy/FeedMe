      "content": "AI features are expanding to all kinds of apps, and it's getting difficult to find a service that hasn't embraced AI. Lately, AI playlists in music apps have been growing in popularity, and it's plausible that we'll see Apple adopt the trend in the near future.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1015703\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/iOS-26-Music-Glass-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br/>\n<h2>YouTube</h2>\r<br/>\nThis week, YouTube Music <a href=\"https://x.com/UpdatesFromYT/status/2020909475264332211\">started rolling out</a> a new AI playlist feature. YouTube Premium and YouTube Music Premium subscribers can turn an idea, mood, or genre into a personalized playlist.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/youtube-music-ai-playlists.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1035873\" />\r<br/>\nThere's an option in the Library section of the YouTube Music app to create an AI playlist, where you can ask for or type any genre, artist, feeling, phrase, or other suggestion to get a custom playlist suggestion.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Spotify</h2>\r<br/>\nIn January, Spotify started <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2026-01-22/prompted-playlists-expansion/\">an expanded test</a> of a \"Prompted Playlist\" feature that uses AI to generate music suggestions based on a text-based request.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/spotify-ai-playlists.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1401\" height=\"788\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1035874\" />\r<br/>\nSpotify Premium users can describe what they want to hear, and the AI looks at listening history, current trends, and charts to create song suggestions that fit the parameters. AI playlists are kept up to date and refreshed as listening patterns change.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSpotify says users can ask for things like \"music from my top artists from the last five years,\" then expand on that with a follow-up request like \"and feature deep cuts I haven't heard yet.\" Requests can also cover specific activities and time periods, such as \"high-energy pop and hip-hop for a 30-minute 5K run that keeps a steady pace before easing into relaxing songs for a cool-down.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAI playlists from Spotify can be tweaked with prompt edits, and set to refresh daily or weekly with new music.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSpotify's Prompted Playlists are an expansion of a prior playlist-generating feature that let users ask for songs based on mood and activity. Prompted Playlists can be much more specific and detailed.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Amazon Music</h2>\r<br/>\nSince 2024, Amazon's music service has offered \"Maestro,\" a feature that lets users build playlists using text-based prompts and emoji characters. It's a lot like the YouTube and Spotify options, with Amazon describing it as a feature that helps users create any playlist they can think of.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/amazon-maestro-music-ai.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1320\" height=\"743\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1035875\" />\r<br/>\n<h2>Apple Music Rumors</h2>\r<br/>\nApple has used AI to generate custom \"For You\" playlists for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> users for years, but there isn't an option to type in a prompt and get a customized playlist in response.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLast year, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple was working on an &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; reboot focused around AI. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-music/\">We did get</a> a new AutoMix feature that more seamlessly transitions between songs, and updated lyrics translation features, but no option to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-music-reboot-with-ai-focus/\">generate AI playlists</a> and no specific <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMore of Apple's apps are expected to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/ios-27-to-focus-on-bug-fixes-and-tweaks/\">adopt Apple Intelligence features</a> in iOS 27, so it's possible we'll get new AI &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; features. Apple is now one of the only major streaming music services that does not offer prompt-based AI playlist creation.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn the meantime, there is an option to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/17/chatgpt-apple-music-integration/\">generate Apple Music playlists</a> using ChatGPT. ChatGPT is able to integrate with &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, so it can make music recommendations and playlists based on user prompts. ChatGPT can search the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; catalog, but it does not have access to listening history, which limits the personalization of any playlist suggestions. Playlists also need to be manually added to &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA native AI playlist feature in &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; would be much more akin to what Spotify and YouTube are offering.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/apple-music-ai-playlists-ios-27/\">Will Apple Music Get AI Playlists in iOS 27?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-apple-music-get-ai-playlists-in-ios-27.2477575/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The new free options appear to be a continuation of its effort to target people who don't want to see ads when using a chatbot.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFree users can create, edit, and work with files directly in a Claude conversation using Sonnet 4.5 (Pro users have access to the more capable Opus model). Claude is able to generate Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Word documents, and PDF files.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe new access to connectors will let Claude users connect to third-party services at no cost. There are connectors for a wide variety of <a href=\"https://claude.com/connectors\">apps and services</a>, including Slack, Asana, Zapier, Stripe, Canva, Notion, Figma, and WordPress.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSkills are repeatable filesystem-based resources that give Claude domain-specific expertise. Anthropic offers PowerPoint, Excel, Word, and PDF skills, but users can create custom skills with their domain expertise and organizational knowledge.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnthropic says that free users are also able to engage in longer conversations with Claude thanks to the addition of compaction to the free plan. Compaction allows Claude to automatically summarize earlier context so there isn't a need to start a conversation from the beginning. Anthropic does not appear to have increased the free tier cap, however, so free users will still run into usage limitations.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/anthropic/\">Anthropic</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/anthropic-claude-more-free-features/\">Anthropic&#039;s Claude Gets More Free Features as OpenAI Starts Showing Ads in ChatGPT</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/anthropics-claude-gets-more-free-features-as-openai-starts-showing-ads-in-chatgpt.2477572/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

T-Mobile users can sign up to test live translation on the T-Mobile website, with limited spots available.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe feature works with more than 50 languages, and voice conversations are translated for each speaker \"almost instantly.\" T-Mobile says that users can speak how they normally do on calls, with live translation detecting the languages and voices that are speaking for a natural conversation.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLive translation is built into the T-Mobile network, so it works with any phone on T-Mobile, from iPhones to flip phones. T-Mobile users can even call landlines and get translation capabilities because only one phone connected to the call has to be on T-Mobile for translation to work.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTo use live translation, T-Mobile users will need to sign up for the beta. From there, when on a call, pressing * 87 * on the keypad will initiate the live translation process.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple rolled out a translation feature for phone calls with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, but T-Mobile's version does not require participants to have an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, and it covers more languages.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile live translation is free during the beta testing process, there could be a fee associated in the future.

Available from a tab on the TikTok home screen, the feed features content related to travel, events, restaurants, and shopping, plus posts from nearby small businesses and local creators.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTikTok U.S. says that posts are selected based on location, the topic of the content, and when the content was posted. TikTok users who want access to the Local Feed will need to turn on precise location.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"This approach is consistent with how many modern apps use location today and gives people the choice to enable it when they want more relevant, local experiences, while keeping them in control,\" reads the blog post.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPrecise Location is off by default, and the feature is opt-in with location only relayed when the app is in active use. Location data is \"protected in the TikTok USDS JV secure environment.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTikTok U.S. says that it wants to \"make sure TikTok is useful, locally relevant, and trusted.\" A similar \"Nearby Feeds\" feature rolled out for TikTok users in Europe back in December.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTikTok's U.S. operations were transferred to a majority American-owned TikTok USDS venture <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-avoids-us-ban-deal-officially-closes/\">in late January</a>, and the transition hasn't gone smoothly. TikTok users were unable to upload videos and had posts flagged as ineligible for recommendation, an issue that U.S. TikTok said was due to a power outage at a data center.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC is 80.1 percent owned by U.S. and global investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX. The three companies each own 15 percent as managing investors, and other U.S. stakeholders include the Dell Family Office and affiliates of Susquehanna International Group. TikTok parent company ByteDance continues to hold a 19.9 percent stake.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA seven-member majority-American board of directors is operating the U.S. version of TikTok, with Adam Presser, TikTok's former global head of operations serving as CEO.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUnder the agreement, the venture handles U.S. data protection, content moderation, and algorithm security. TikTok's recommendation algorithm is being retrained and updated on U.S. user data, and it has been secured in Oracle's cloud environment.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/\">TikTok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/tiktok-us-local-feed/\">U.S. TikTok Introduces &#039;Local Feed&#039; to Surface Nearby Events and Content</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/u-s-tiktok-introduces-local-feed-to-surface-nearby-events-and-content.2477568/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple released iOS 26.3 today, and while it doesn't have as many features as iOS 26.1 or iOS 26.2, there are still a couple of new additions worth knowing about.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/iOS-26.3-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029939\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"transfer_to_android\">Transfer to Android</h2>\r<br/>\nApple is making it easier for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users to transition to an Android smartphone in iOS 26.3, introducing a new transfer tool that lets an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user place their device next to an Android device to initiate a transfer process.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030192\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/ios-26-3-android-transfer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nWith the two smartphones connected, users can opt to move over photos, messages, notes, apps, passwords, phone number, and more. Data transfers occur with no need to download and use a separate app, making the process simpler.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHealth data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and protected items like locked notes are not transferred over to the new device. Google has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/08/iphone-android-switching-improvements/\">also implemented</a> a similar feature for transferring data from an Android to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, so it is a two-way process between the two platforms.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"weather_wallpaper\">Weather Wallpaper</h2>\r<br/>\nThere is a new Weather wallpaper section in the Lock Screen customization options. Previously, Apple had a combined section for Weather and Astronomy, but Weather was split out into its own category.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030238\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/ios-26-3-weather.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br/>\nThere are now three pre-designed Weather wallpapers with different fonts for the time and different weather widgets to give users a better idea of how the Weather wallpaper can be used.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"limit_precise_location\">Limit Precise Location</h2>\r<br/>\niOS 26.3 includes a setting to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/ios-26-3-limit-precise-location/\">limit carrier location tracking</a> for carriers that add support for the feature. It's an option that only works with the C1 and C1X modems, which are in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/\">iPhone Air</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012692\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iOS-26-Phone-App-Features.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br/>\nMobile networks determine location based on the cellular towers that a device connects to, but with the setting enabled, some of the data typically made available to mobile networks will be restricted. Rather than being able to see location down to a street address, carriers will instead be limited to the neighborhood where a device is located, for example.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn the United States, only Boost Mobile is supporting the feature as of now. EE and BT in the UK offer it, as does Telekom in Germany and AIS and True in Thailand.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYou can enable the setting on a compatible device by opening the Settings app, tapping on your cellular service, tapping on Mobile Data Options, and then toggling on Limit Precise Location. You'll need to restart your device when turning the setting on or off.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"signs_of_m5_chips\">Signs of M5 Chips</h2>\r<br/>\nThe iOS 26.3 release candidate featured references to unreleased <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/new-m5-chips-ios-26-3-beta/\">M5 Max and M5 Ultra chips</a> that could be used in upcoming Macs over the course of the next month or two.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"notification_forwarding_-_eu_only\">Notification Forwarding - EU Only</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the iOS 26.3 beta, Apple tested a new \"Notification Forwarding\" setting that allows incoming notifications on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to be forwarded to a third-party wearable device like an Android smartwatch. Apple may have decided to delay this functionality until iOS 26.4.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030197\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/ios-26-3-notification-forwarding.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2114\" height=\"1189\" />\r<br/>\nThe setting was available in the Notification section of the Settings app under a new \"Notification Forwarding\" option. Notifications can only be forwarded to a single device at a time, so if Notification Forwarding is enabled with a third-party wearable, the Apple Watch won't be able to receive and display notifications.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is adding this feature to address antitrust complaints suggesting that third-party wearables should have the same access to notifications and other features as the Apple Watch. It is limited to the European Union.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"proximity_pairing_-_eu_only\">Proximity Pairing - EU Only</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the iOS 26.3 beta, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/22/ios-26-3-dma-airpods-pairing/\">added other Europe-only changes</a> for third-party wearables, which were shared by the European Commission. Devices like headphones and smartwatches are able to use some of the same functionality available to the AirPods and the Apple Watch going forward.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nProximity pairing allows third-party devices to pair with an iOS device in an AirPods-like one-tap way by bringing an accessory close to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"security_updates\">Security Updates</h2>\r<br/>\niOS 26.3 addresses <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/ios-26-3-security-vulnerabilities/\">dozens of security vulnerabilities</a>, including one bug that was known to be actively exploited.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple says that a vulnerability in the dyld dynamic link editor allowed for the execution of arbitrary code. The bug may have been used in an \"extremely sophisticated attack\" against targeted individuals in versions of iOS before <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are several other vulnerabilities that were fixed too, across apps and services. A CoreAudio bug could allow a maliciously crafted media file to terminate an app, and a bug with Game Center could allow users to view sensitive information. A vulnerability in Messages could allow a shortcut to bypass sandbox restrictions, and an issue in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> could allow someone with physical access to an iOS device to get to photos from the Lock Screen.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNow that the vulnerabilities have been publicized by Apple, even those that were not exploited before might be taken advantage of now. Apple recommends all users update their devices to iOS 26.3, iPadOS 26.3, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/\">macOS Tahoe</a> 26.3 as soon as possible.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"how_to_update\">How to Update</h2>\r<br/>\nYou can install iOS 26.3 by opening up the Settings app, tapping into the General section, and navigating to Software Update.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"compatibility\">Compatibility</h2>\r<br/>\niOS 26.3 is available on all iPhones that support &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, which includes the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 and later.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"whats_next\">What's Next</h2>\r<br/>\nApple is likely to release the first beta of its next update, iOS 26.4, in two weeks.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-3-features/\">iOS 26.3 Features: Everything New in iOS 26.3</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-3-features-everything-new-in-ios-26-3.2477566/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple has \"run into snags\" testing the more personalized, smarter version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> that's planned for iOS 26.4, reports <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-11/apple-s-ios-26-4-siri-update-runs-into-snags-in-internal-testing-ios-26-5-27\">Bloomberg</a></em>. Because of the issues, the upcoming &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features will be spread across several upcoming iOS releases and won't all come in the spring iOS 26.4 update.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Sad-Siri-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-994723\" />\r<br/>\nApple could postpone some or all of the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features until iOS 26.5, an update planned for May, and iOS 27, which will launch this September.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe've been waiting on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; since iOS 18, when Apple debuted the features at the 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference. At the time, rumors suggested a spring 2025 launch. When spring rolled around, Apple announced that the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/\">would take longer than expected</a>, with the functionality delayed for a year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSince then, Apple has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/apple-intelligence-siri-spring-2026/\">targeting iOS 26.4</a>, which the company will begin testing later this month. As Apple has been testing the updated version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; ahead of the release of the first iOS 26.4 beta, there have been unforeseen problems. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; sometimes doesn't properly process queries and can take too long to respond to requests.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple engineers have been told to use iOS 26.5 for further internal testing, suggesting the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features will be delayed until that update. Internally, iOS 26.5 includes notices describing the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features, as well as a \"preview\" toggle for turning on the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; personalization feature that lets the personal assistant tap into user data like text messages and emails.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEmployees that are testing iOS 26.5 say the update includes all of the features Apple promised, including personalization, onscreen awareness, and the ability for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to do more in and between apps, but not all of the features are working reliably and there are problems with accuracy.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; also apparently sometimes falls back on using ChatGPT for information instead of relying on the Gemini-powered technology that Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/google-gemini-future-apple-intelligence-features/\">partnered with Google</a> to use, even when the new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is capable of handling a user's request.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple also planned to include features that haven't been announced, such as options to generate images or search the web. Image generation and web search were tested as part of iOS 26.4, and it's possible they will still be included in the update, so Apple might still be able to announce some of the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality. Image generation uses <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/\">Image Playground</a>, and web search summarizes information from the web.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<em>Bloomberg</em> says the situation is \"fluid,\" though, so Apple's plans could change, and executives are reluctant to further delay the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality beyond spring 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are still major changes planned for iOS 27, with Apple aiming to add chatbot functionality to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to allow it to better compete with chatbots like Gemini, Claude, and ChatGPT. That version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will have deep integration with Apple's operating systems.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/siri-features-delayed-ios-26-4/\">New Siri Runs Into Problems, Features Could Be Pushed to iOS 26.5 and iOS 27</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-siri-runs-into-problems-features-could-be-pushed-to-ios-26-5-and-ios-27.2477561/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

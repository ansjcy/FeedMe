      "content": "In the iOS 26.4 update that's coming this spring, Apple will introduce a new version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> that's going to overhaul how we interact with the personal assistant and what it's able to do.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1014637\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/Finder-Siri-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br/>\nThe iOS 26.4 version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; won't work like ChatGPT or Claude, but it will rely on large language models (LLMs) and has been updated from the ground up.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"llm_siri\">Upgraded Architecture</h2>\r<br/>\nThe next-generation version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will use advanced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/21/apple-llm-siri-2026/\">large language models</a>, similar to those used by ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Apple isn't implementing full chatbot interactions, but <em>any</em> upgrade is both better than what's available now and long overdue.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRight now, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; uses machine learning, but it doesn't have the reasoning capabilities that LLM models impart. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; relies on multiple task-specific models to complete a request, going from one step to another. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has to determine the intent of a request, pull out relevant information (a time, an event, a name, etc), and then use APIs or apps to complete the request. It's not an all-in-one system.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn iOS 26.4, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will have an LLM core that everything else is built around. Instead of just translating voice to text and looking for keywords to execute on, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will actually understand the specifics of what a user is asking, and use reasoning to get it done.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>LLM Improvements</h2>\r<br/>\n&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; today is usually fine for simple tasks like setting a timer or alarm, sending a text message, toggling a smart home device on or off, answering a simple question, or controlling a device function, but it doesn't understand anything more complicated, it can't complete multi-step tasks, it can't interpret wording that's not in the structure it wants, it has no personal context, and it doesn't support follow-up questions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAn LLM should solve most of those problems because &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will have something akin to a brain. LLMs can understand the nuance of a request, suss out what it is someone actually wants, and take the steps to deliver that information or complete the requested action.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe already know some of what LLM &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to do because Apple described the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> features it wants to implement when iOS 18 debuted.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Promised Siri Apple Intelligence Features</h2>\r<br/>\nApple described three specific ways that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will improve, including personal context, the ability to see what's on the screen to know what the user is talking about, and the capability to do more in and between apps.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will understand pronouns, references to content on the screen and in apps, and it will have a short-term memory for follow-up requests.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"personal_context\">Personal Context</h3>\r<br/>\nWith personal context, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to keep track of emails, messages, files, photos, and more, learning more about you to help you complete tasks and keep track of what you've been sent.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Show me the files Eric sent me last week.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Find the email where Eric mentioned ice skating.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Find the books that Eric recommended to me.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Where's the recipe that Eric sent me?</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>What's my passport number?</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"onscreen_awareness\">Onscreen Awareness</h3>\r<br/>\nOnscreen awareness will let &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; see what's on your screen and complete actions involving whatever you're looking at. If someone texts you an address, for example, you can tell &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to add it to their contact card. Or if you're looking at a photo and want to send it to someone, you can ask &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to do it for you.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"deeper_app_integration\">Deeper App Integration</h3>\r<br/>\nDeeper app integration means that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to do more in and across apps, performing actions and completing tasks that are just not possible with the personal assistant right now. We don't have a full picture of what &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be capable of, but Apple has provided a few examples of what to expect.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Moving files from one app to another.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Editing a photo and then sending it to someone.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Get directions home and share the ETA with Eric.</li>\r<br/>\n \t<li>Send the email I drafted to Eric.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\n<h2>Bigger Than Promised Update</h2>\r<br/>\nIn an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/01/tim-cook-apple-all-hands-meeting-ai/\">all-hands meeting in August 2025</a>, Apple software engineering chief Craig Federighi explained the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; debacle to employees. Apple had attempted to merge two separate systems, which didn't work out.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere was one system for handling current commands and another based on large language models, and the hybrid approach <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/apple-explains-personalized-siri-delay/\">was not working</a> due to the confines of the current &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; architecture. The only way forward was to upgrade to the second-generation architecture built around a large language model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn the August meeting, Federighi said Apple had successfully revamped &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, and that Apple would be able to introduce a bigger upgrade than it promised in iOS 18.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"The work we've done on this end-to-end revamp of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has given us the results we needed,\" Federighi told employees. \"This has put us in a position to not just deliver what we announced, but to deliver a much bigger upgrade than that we envisioned.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Adopting Google Gemini</h2>\r<br/>\nPart of Apple's problem was that it was relying on AI models that it built in-house, and that were not able to match the capabilities of competitors. Apple started considering <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-chatgpt-claude-siri/\">using a third-party model</a> for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; and other future AI features shortly after delaying &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, and in January, Apple announced a multi-year partnership with Google.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor the foreseeable future, Apple's AI features, including the more personalized version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, will use a custom model Apple built in collaboration with Google's Gemini team. Apple plans to continue work on its own in-house models, but for now, it will rely on Gemini for many public-facing features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; in iOS 26.4 will be more similar to Google Gemini than &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; today, though without full chatbot capabilities. Apple plans to continue to run some features on-device and use Private Cloud Compute to maintain privacy. Apple will keep personal data on-device, anonymize requests, and continue to allow AI features to be disabled.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>What's Not Coming in iOS 26.4</h2>\r<br/>\n&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is not going to work as a chatbot, so the updated version will not feature long-term memory or back-and-forth conversations, plus Apple plans to use the same voice-based interface with limited typing functionality.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Apple's Embarrassing Siri Delay</h2>\r<br/>\nIn what became an infamous move, Apple went all-in showing off a smarter, Apple Intelligence-powered version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; when it introduced iOS 18 at the 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference. Apple said these features would come in an update to iOS 18, but right around when launch was expected, Apple admitted that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; wasn't ready and would be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/\">delayed until spring 2026</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-994006\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-More-Personal-Siri-Ad.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple executives went on a press tour to explain the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; shortcomings after WWDC 2025, promising bigger and better things for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, and explaining what went wrong. The &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features we saw at WWDC 2024 were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/apple-says-personalized-siri-was-working/\">actually implemented</a> and weren't faked, but &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; wasn't working as well as expected behind the scenes and Apple was dealing with quality issues.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSince Apple advertised the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, some people who bought the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> because of the new functionality were upset about the delay <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/26/apple-responds-to-delayed-siri-features-lawsuit/\">and sued</a>. Apple was able to quietly settle the case in December 2025, so most of the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; snafu has been resolved.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Internal Restructuring</h3>\r<br/>\nThe misstep with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s debut and the failure of the hybrid architecture led Apple to restructure its entire AI team. Apple AI chief John Giannandrea was removed from the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; leadership team, with Vision Pro chief Mike Rockwell <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/siri-leadership-shakeup/\">taking over instead</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> was no longer confident in Giannandrea's ability to oversee product development, and Giannandrea is set to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/apple-ai-chief-retiring-after-siri-failure/\">retire in spring 2026</a>. Rockwell reports to Federighi, and Federighi told employees that the new leadership has \"supercharged\" &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; development. Federighi has apparently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/22/new-apple-ai-strategy-firms-up/\">played an instrumental role</a> in changing Apple's approach to AI, and he is making the decisions that will allow the company to catch up to rivals.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple has struggled with retaining AI employees amid the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; issue and recruitment strategies from companies like Meta. Meta poached <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/29/apple-continues-losing-ai-experts-to-meta/\">several key AI engineers</a> from Apple, offering pay packages as high as &#36;200 million. At Apple's August all-hands meeting, Cook and Federighi aimed to reassure employees that AI is critically important to the company. \"There is no project people are taking more seriously,\" Federighi said of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCook said that Apple will \"make the investment\" to be a leader in AI.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>iOS 26.4 Siri Launch Date</h2>\r<br/>\nApple has promised that the new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is coming in spring 2026, which is when we're expecting iOS 26.4. Testing on iOS 26.4 should begin in late February or early March, with a launch to follow around the April timeframe.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>LLM Siri Compatibility</h2>\r<br/>\nThe new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will presumably run on all devices that support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, though Apple hasn't explicitly provided details. Some new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; capabilities may come to older devices as well.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>iOS 27 Chatbot Upgrade</h2>\r<br/>\nApple plans to upgrade &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; even further in the iOS 27 update, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri-chatbot/\">turning Siri into a chatbot</a>. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will work like Claude or ChatGPT, able to understand and engage in back and forth conversation.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDetails about the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; interface and how a chatbot version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will work are still in short supply, but iOS 26.4 will be a stop on the path to a version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; able to actually function like products from Anthropic and OpenAI.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/06/siri-ios-26-4-rumors/\">Why Apple&#039;s iOS 26.4 Siri Upgrade Will Be Bigger Than Originally Promised</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/why-apples-ios-26-4-siri-upgrade-will-be-bigger-than-originally-promised.2477310/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "It's been four months since the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/\">iPhone Air</a> came out, and it hasn't exactly been a resounding success. Sales are reportedly so low that Apple is delaying the next-generation model. <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera shares what it's been like using Apple's thinnest and lightest <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> on a daily basis over the last few months.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe title=\"iPhone Air Long Term Review: I Love It, But Should You Buy It?\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AwVhXeEPHzc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br/>\nWith its super thin design, the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; still impresses even months later. It's much lighter than the other &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, and a pleasure to use because of it. The &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; is Apple's best one-handed smartphone, plus it impresses everyone who tries it out.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe frosted glass texture is attractive, and thanks to that titanium frame, it's durable. The glass resists fingerprints, plus it's not slippery, so it can be used without a case. That's a good thing, since a case tends to ruin the ultra thin feel. The &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; is all glass, though, so it's still breakable if dropped and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a>+ is recommended.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; has the smallest battery in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> lineup, and there was a lot of concern that it wouldn't last all day. As long as you're not using it for high-end gaming, the battery is totally fine. Dan hasn't had a problem with battery life for day-to-day activities like browsing social media, YouTube, navigating, and using <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf you're someone who only uses the Wide camera on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, you might not miss the Ultra Wide or Telephoto lenses, but having only a single-lens rear camera is one of the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;'s major downsides. You get 1x and 2x zoom, but no 0.5x mode, no macro lens, and no 5x telephoto lens. It's definitely a dealbreaker for some people.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere's also only a single speaker, and while it's fine for use in quiet rooms, if you like to use your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; for things like listening to music in the shower, it might not be good enough.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe biggest thing wrong with the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; is the price tag. Sure, it's light, thin, and has an impressive design, but it's &#36;999. For &#36;200 less, you can get the standard &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; with two cameras and near identical performance, and for &#36;100 more, you can get the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, which has three cameras and faster performance. The only sacrifice is thinness, and it's clear that most people aren't willing to pay more to lose features for a thin and light design.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAt this point, it's not entirely clear when a new &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; is coming out. Rumors originally suggested we'd get the second-generation model in the fall of 2026, but sales were below expectations, so Apple is holding back on a new model to make some changes.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe next &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; could have a second camera and display improvements like a smaller <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a> to make it more appealing, with a potential launch happening in spring 2027.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/\">iPhone Air</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-Air\">iPhone Air (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/06/iphone-air-four-month-review/\">iPhone Air Review: Four Months Later, is Apple&#039;s Thinnest iPhone Worth &#36;999?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-air-review-four-months-later-is-apples-thinnest-iphone-worth-999.2477302/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Third-party AI voice apps will not be accessible via a wake word and won't replace &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, so users will need to open an app to get access to a chatbot.

      "content": "For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2FAstropad%2Fpage%2F7A0D4682-3671-4F59-A263-926917F2940E\">Astropad</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> and one of Astropad's <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0G6GRGCLW\">anti-reflective Fresh Coat screen protectors</a> to go along with it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030682\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-main.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br/>\nFresh Coat is a new kind of screen protector that Astropad designed with an optical-grade anti-reflective coating to reduce glare and provide a better <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> viewing experience. The technology that Astropad is using cuts reflections by 75 percent, while improving contrast and keeping colors vibrant. Unlike other anti-reflective screen protectors on the market, Fresh Coat has adds no haze or distortion.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030688\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-comparison-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0G6GRGCLW\">Priced at &#36;30</a>, Fresh Coat is made from a scratch-proof tempered glass that also provides protection for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display in addition to cutting down on glare and reflections. It's slim and won't add any bulk to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; even though there are five layers of technology at work. From the top down, there's an anti-reflective coating, an oleophobic and hydrophobic coating, a layer of tempered glass, a dust barrier, and an impact-resistant \"airbag\" bonding.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030684\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-layers.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br/>\nIf you have an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, it comes with an anti-reflective coating added by Apple. What you might not know, though, is that you can't use just any screen protector with the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;. If you put a regular screen protector without an anti-reflective coating on, it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/04/iphone-17-screen-protector-anti-reflective-issue/\">nullifies</a> the anti-reflective properties of that added coating.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/fresh-coat-astropad-chart.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1839\" height=\"1153\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1035468\" />\r<br/>\nSince Fresh Coat has its own anti-reflective coating, it actually improves upon Apple's included anti-reflective layer, reducing glare even further. With Fresh Coat, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s screen is easy to see in any lighting conditions, there's less eye strain, and if you use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/\">Dark Mode</a>, it looks even darker.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030686\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-description.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br/>\nIf you don't have an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, Fresh Coat can provide an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17-style display upgrade, mirroring Apple's own reflection-reducing display coating. Fresh Coat is available for all &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> Pro and Pro Max, and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 15 Pro and Pro Max.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030687\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/astropad-fresh-coat-comparison-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br/>\nAstropad designed an installation process that's impossible to mess up, so you get perfect alignment on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; without hassle.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe have an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; in white and a <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0G6GRGCLW\">Fresh Coat screen protector</a> for one lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader.

These two teams already met in the 2015 Super Bowl, which ended in a Patriots championship.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe big game is airing on NBC and streaming on Peacock Premium this year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOne way to stream the 2026 Super Bowl for free on the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV in the U.S. is to sign up for a free 30-day trial to Walmart+, which <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/help/article/walmart-benefits-streaming-services/35624ec8e133496ab647a398a90cf779\">includes free access to Peacock Premium's ad-supported tier</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYou can <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/plus\">sign up for a Walmart+ trial online</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNext, here is how to activate free, ad-supported Peacock Premium via Walmart+:<ul>\r<br/>\n  <li>Sign into your Walmart account.</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Go to your Account page.</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Select Walmart+.</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Find Peacock Premium in the Benefits Hub.</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Select Get Peacock.</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Log in or create your streaming service account.</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Follow the on-screen steps to finish setting up your account.</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Build your profile and start streaming.</li></ul>Then, you can sign in to your Peacock account tied to Walmart+ in the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/peacock-tv-stream-tv-movies/id1508186374\">Peacock app on the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV</a>. On the Mac, you can sign in <a href=\"https://www.peacocktv.com/\">on the Peacock website</a>. As mentioned, these are Apple-focused instructions, but they apply to many other devices too.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn addition to the Super Bowl itself, you can watch the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/16/2026-apple-music-halftime-show-trailer/\">Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show</a>, featuring Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDo not forget that a Walmart+ subscription automatically renews after the 30-day free trial.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/super-bowl/\">Super Bowl</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/06/2026-super-bowl-watch-free-iphone-apple-tv/\">How to Watch 2026 Super Bowl LX For Free on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-watch-2026-super-bowl-lx-for-free-on-iphone-ipad-mac-and-apple-tv.2477293/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

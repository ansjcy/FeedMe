      "content": "Back at WWDC 2025, Apple revealed that it was planning to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/carplay-airplay-video-in-the-car/\">allow CarPlay users to watch video via AirPlay in their vehicles</a> while they are not driving, and the first beta of iOS 26.4 suggests the feature may be nearing availability.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Apple-CarPlay-iOS-26-Tight-Crop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2880\" height=\"1620\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034782\" />\r<br/>\nThe original mention of the feature appeared on <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/carplay/\">Apple's CarPlay page for developers</a> within a section specific to automakers, indicating that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a> with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a> video is something automakers will need to implement with on their end. Presumably, this is because there needs to be integration with vehicle systems to ensure that the feature can only be used while the vehicle is parked so as to hinder the potential for distracted driving.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe first iOS 26.4 beta seeded to developers today includes a number of new references to &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; video playback, including features like onboarding flows, notifications, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUnsurprisingly, it appears that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> will likely support the &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; video feature when it launches, as there are additional references to interacting with the TV app while using &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, such as a message that would pop up informing users that they will need to subscribe to &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; on their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> while not driving if they attempt to access subscription content.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile the new code in iOS 26.4 provides evidence that Apple is moving toward launching the feature, there are no guarantees that it will ultimately become available with the public release of the update, as Apple sometimes removes code found in early betas or continues building on it in subsequent updates before the features go live. And with car manufacturers needing to add support for it on their end, it's unclear how quickly &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; video will roll out across various makes and models once the feature does launch.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/ios-26-4-carplay-video-apple-tv/\">iOS 26.4 Lays Groundwork for CarPlay Video, Including Apple TV</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-4-lays-groundwork-for-carplay-video-including-apple-tv.2477816/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple today provided developers with the first beta of an upcoming iOS 26.4 update, which adds quite a few new features to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. There's a video podcasts feature, updates to Stolen Device Protection, end-to-end encryption for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/\">RCS</a> messages, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> tool for generating playlists, and much more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/iOS-26.4-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1033519\" />\r<br/>\nWe've rounded up everything we've found that's new in the first beta of iOS 26.4. The beta is limited to developers right now, but Apple should release a public beta in the next couple of weeks. iOS 26.4 is expected to launch this spring.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"playlist_playground\">Playlist Playground</h2>\r<br/>\n&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; has a new Playlist Playground feature that lets users create a playlist with a text-based prompt. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/ios-26-4-playlist-playground.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036489\" />\r<br/>\nIn the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app, there's an option to type in an idea and get automatic song suggestions for a playlist. Apple has some pre-set suggestions that include \"morning coffee music,\" \"hip-hop party songs,\" and \"disco songs that defined the 1970s,\" but you can type in any idea, mood, or feeling. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFrom there, the Playlist Playground feature will automatically generate a list of 25 songs, along with a custom title. Playlists that you create can be customized further with additional text prompts, and you can select a cover and a description.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"apple_music\">Apple Music</h2>\r<br/>\n&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; features a \"Concerts Near You\" feature that helps you find shows in your area and tour dates for artists that you're a fan of.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/ios-26-4-apple-music.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036493\" />\r<br/>\nApple has redesigned albums and playlists, adding full-page artwork.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"apple_podcasts\">Apple Podcasts</h2>\r<br/>\nWith iOS 26.4, Apple is adding <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/ios-26-4-video-podcasts-apple/\">video podcast capabilities</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/\">Apple Podcasts</a> app. The feature uses HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) to provide podcast creators with \"unprecedented control and monetization opportunities\" while also providing a high-quality viewing experience.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/apple-podcasts-video.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036464\" />\r<br/>\nThe iOS 26.4 Podcasts app will let users switch between watching and listening to shows, with videos able to be downloaded for offline viewing. HLS ensures smooth playback regardless of network connection, so videos will work on Wi-Fi or cellular. Apple says that the new video episodes will integrate with existing &zwnj;Apple Podcasts&zwnj; features, including personalized recommendations and editorial suggestions in the New and Category sections.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"stolen_device_protection\">Stolen Device Protection</h2>\r<br/>\nStolen Device Protection is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/ios-26-4-stolen-device-protection/\">now enabled by default</a> for all &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users, rather than being an opt-in feature.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/ios-26-4-stolen-device-protection.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036492\" />\r<br/>\nApple implemented Stolen Device Protection back in 2023 after reports about a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; theft method. Thieves would spy on an intended victim to learn their passcode, then steal the target's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. With the passcode, criminals were able to empty bank accounts, access passwords, and turn off <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nStolen Device Protection requires additional authentication through <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> to access certain &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; features like the Passwords app, Lost mode in &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;, Safari purchases, and more. Some features are disabled entirely without authentication, while others have a one-hour security delay.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"end-to-end_rcs_encryption_for_messages\">End-to-End RCS Encryption for Messages</h2>\r<br/>\nWith iOS 26.4, iPadOS 26.4, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/\">macOS Tahoe</a> 26.4, Apple is testing end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; messages, a security feature that is not currently available for cross-platform messaging.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/ios-26-4-rcs-messaging.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036495\" />\r<br/>\nApple has been working with the GSM Association to implement E2EE for &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; messages. iMessage, the messaging protocol for sending texts between iPhones, has long supported end-to-end encryption. &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; messages between Android devices have also featured E2EE, but there was no full encryption for Android to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; (or vice versa) communications. With the addition of E2EE for &zwnj;RCS&zwnj;, messages between &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users and Android users will eventually be just as secure as iMessage.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMessages sent by &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; that have end-to-end encryption will feature a lock icon in the conversation interface. As of right now, Apple is testing iPhone-to-iPhone &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; encryption, with the feature set to roll out for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Android conversations in a future <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a> update.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMessages that feature E2EE will feature a lock icon in the conversation UI, both for iMessages and &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; Messages.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"messages_app\">Messages App</h2>\r<br/>\nThere are new animations in the Messages app for actions like launching a new conversation.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"apple_account_unified_design\">Apple Account Unified Design</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, and other apps that have user settings, there is a new unified Apple Account hub that replaces the existing profile feature.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/ios-26-4-apple-account-hub.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036494\" />\r<br/>\nIt offers largely the same functionality as the prior profile settings for each app, but there is a new unified design.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; merges apps and purchase history, and has a dedicated section for app updates. It now takes two taps to get to app updates rather than having them available at the bottom of the profile page.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;'s navigation bar also no longer features Search as a separate button, and the search bar itself is at the top when tapped rather than the bottom.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"ambient_music_widget\">Ambient Music Widget</h2>\r<br/>\nThere is a new Ambient Music widget for the Home and Lock Screen. It supports playing different built-in ambient music options for sleep, productivity, wellbeing, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/ios-26-4-ambient-music-widget.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036496\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"wallpaper_and_watch_face_gallery\">Wallpaper and Watch Face Gallery</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Wallpaper Gallery has an updated design that allows Wallpapers from each category like Weather, Astronomy, Emoji, Colors and More to be downloaded to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/ios-26-4-wallpaper-gallery.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036497\" />\r<br/>\nThe Watch Face Gallery in the Apple Watch app also features the same design change.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"freeform_creator_studio\">Freeform Creator Studio</h2>\r<br/>\nFreeform Creator Studio is live in iOS 26.4, allowing Creator Studio subscribers to access new Freeform features. Creator Studio for Freeform adds a dedicated Content Hub that houses the Freeform shape options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/ios-26-4-freeform-creator-studio.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036498\" />\r<br/>\nCreator Studio users will be able to access free, high-quality content like graphics, photos, and illustrations that are not available to non-subscribers, plus there are AI capabilities for creating and editing images.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen Creator Studio launched, Apple said the premium content and features in Freeform would be coming to the Apple Creator Studio subscription later this year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFreeform also has a new icon.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"reminders\">Reminders</h2>\r<br/>\nThe Reminders app has a new \"Urgent\" section. Reminders that have Urgent toggled on during creation will show up here. Urgent ensures that reminders have an accompanying alarm so you get a clear warning when a reminder is due. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/ios-26-4-reminders-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036501\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"icloud_web_settings\">iCloud Web Settings</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> section of the Settings app, there's now an \"iCloud.com\" option if you scroll all the way to the bottom of the interface. It replaces the simple \"Access &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Data on the Web\" toggle that was previously available.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/ios-26-4-icloud-web.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036500\" />\r<br/>\nThe setting includes a new \"Allow Search\" toggle that lets trusted Apple devices provide search results to iCloud.com.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"new_emoji\">New Emoji</h2>\r<br/>\nThere aren't new emoji in iOS 26.4, but code suggests that new characters will be introduced in a future beta. There are references to new emoji, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/17/ios-26-emoji-characters/\">we are expecting</a> several new emoji options.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-992499\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-18.4-Emoji-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br/>\nEmoji characters that are coming include trombone, treasure chest, distorted face, hairy creature (aka Bigfoot or Sasquatch), fight cloud, apple core, orca, landslide, and ballet dancers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"notification_forwarding_for_third-party_devices_eu\">Notification Forwarding for Third-Party Devices (EU)</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the iOS 26.3 beta, Apple tested a new \"Notification Forwarding\" setting that allows incoming notifications on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to be forwarded to a third-party wearable device like an Android smartwatch, but it was not included in the launch version of the software. It is back in the iOS 26.4 beta.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030197\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/ios-26-3-notification-forwarding.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2114\" height=\"1189\" />\r<br/>\nNotifications can only be forwarded to a single device at a time, so if Notification Forwarding is enabled with a third-party wearable, the Apple Watch won't be able to receive and display notifications.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is adding notification forwarding to address antitrust complaints suggesting that third-party wearables should have the same access to notifications and other features as the Apple Watch. It is limited to the European Union.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"proximity_pairing_-_eu_only\">Proximity Pairing - EU Only</h2>\r<br/>\nIn the iOS 26.3 beta, Apple also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/22/ios-26-3-dma-airpods-pairing/\">tested other Europe-only changes</a> for third-party wearables, which were shared by the European Commission, such as Proximity Pairing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nProximity pairing allows third-party devices to pair with an iOS device in an AirPods-like one-tap way by bringing an accessory close to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>. Proximity Pairing was not enabled in iOS 26.3, and it too may come in iOS 26.4.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-4-beta-features/\">Everything New in iOS 26.4 Beta 1</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/everything-new-in-ios-26-4-beta-1.2477804/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

There is a new slider bar that lets Mac users select a charge level from 80 percent to 100 percent.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/macos-26-4-charge-limit.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1769\" height=\"995\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036511\" />\r<br/>\nThe Charge Limit is a setting that's available in addition to Optimized Battery Charging, and it can prevent a Mac from ever charging to 100 percent.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's existing Optimized Battery Charging feature keeps a Mac from charging to 100 percent until it's needed for use, with the option using your daily charging routine to determine when to charge to full. While Optimized Battery Charging can help preserve battery life, it still regularly allows a Mac to charge to 100 percent.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe new Charge Limit feature is a hard restriction that keeps a Mac's battery at 80 percent, 85 percent, 90 percent, 95 percent, or 100 percent, giving users more control over the Mac's maximum charging level. Keeping a Mac's battery at 80 percent could increase battery longevity by preserving battery health over time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCharge Limit can be enabled by opening up the System Settings app, going to Battery, and clicking on the \"i\" button next to Charging.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's iPhones have had a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/24/iphone-80-percent-charging-test/\">charge limit feature</a> since the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 15 lineup launched in 2023.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/\">macOS Tahoe</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-tahoe.250\">macOS Tahoe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/mac-charge-limit-macos-tahoe-26-4/\">Apple Brings iPhone-Style Battery Charge Limits to the Mac in macOS Tahoe 26.4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-brings-iphone-style-battery-charge-limits-to-the-mac-in-macos-tahoe-26-4.2477803/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

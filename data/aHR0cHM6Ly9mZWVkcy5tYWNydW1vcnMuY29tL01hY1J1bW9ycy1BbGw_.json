      "content": "The next-generation low-cost <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> will use Apple's A19 chip, according to a report from <em><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3007341/2026-ipads-revealed-a19-base-model-m4-air-with-apples-n1-chip-coming-soon.html\">Macworld</a></em>. <em>Macworld</em> claims to have seen an \"internal Apple code document\" with information about the 2026 &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/ipad-blue-prime-day.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022300\" />\r<br/>\nPrior documentation discovered by <em>MacRumors</em> suggested that the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 12 would be equipped <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/ipad-mini-a19-pro-chip/\">with an A18 chip</a>, not an A19 chip. The A19 chip was just released this year <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">in the iPhone 17</a>, and it would be unusual for Apple to use a current-generation chip in the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; due to cost.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's most affordable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; has not had a current-generation chip since the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 4, which is back when Apple was still designing AX chips for its tablet lineup. The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 5 that came out in 2017 used the A9 chip that was originally introduced in the 2015 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 6s, and since then, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; has been equipped with an A-series chip that's a generation or two behind the chip in the most recently released &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe current &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 11 that was released in March 2025 uses the A16 chip that first debuted in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 in 2022, for example. The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 10 (October 2022) used the A14 (September 2020), the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 9 (September 2021) used the A13 (September 2019), and the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 8 (September 2020) used the A12 (September 2018). A 2024 A18 chip for the 2026 &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; would be in line with prior launches.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe model numbers listed in <em>Macworld</em>'s report are also unusual. It says that J581 and J588 are the codenames for the upcoming 12th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, but codenames are typically sequential. Codenames are how Apple references unreleased devices in its software. In prior code leaks, J581 and J582 appeared to reference the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 12.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPrior leaks have suggested that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> will use the A19 chip, but the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; was previously referenced in Apple code as J510 and J511. Apple sometimes changes its plans and makes updates to unreleased devices, so the A19 chip for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; can't be ruled out entirely.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt is not yet clear if <em>Macworld</em> is correct about the A19 chip for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; given previous information, but other parts of the report seem more in line with expectations. <em>Macworld</em> suggests the next-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> will use an M4 chip, and that both the upcoming &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will be equipped with Apple's N1 networking chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; typically gets an M-series chip that's a generation behind the chip in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, and since it's been updated to the M5, the M4 makes sense for the next &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. Apple has also been adding the new N1 networking chip to newly released devices, starting with this year's iPhones. The N1 chip is an Apple-designed Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip that's more energy efficient than chips designed by third-party companies.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is expected to release the new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models early in 2026.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Neutral)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/10/ipad-12-a19-chip/\">iPad 12 Rumored to Get iPhone 17&#039;s A19 Chip, Breaking Apple Tradition</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-12-rumored-to-get-iphone-17s-a19-chip-breaking-apple-tradition.2474489/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1586\">App Store Accountability Act</a> would require Apple to verify a person's age when an Apple Account is created using a \"commercially available method or process,\" and get parental consent for each app that a child under 16 downloads.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-833991\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Desaturated.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br/>\nCook conveyed to lawmakers that device-level age assurance proposals should not require the collection of sensitive data like birth certificate or social security number, and that parents should be trusted to provide the age of a child when creating a child's account. Any data used for determining age should not be kept by app stores or developers, according to Apple.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCook also emphasized that age assurance efforts should focus on ensuring parents creating an account are adults, plus he suggested that parents should decide whether a child's age range  is shared with developers. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPrior to Cook's meeting with the committee, Apple's global head of privacy, Hilary Ware sent a letter expressing Apple's concerns over the legislation. The letter said that the act \"could threaten the privacy of all users by forcing millions of adults to surrender their private information for the simple act of downloading an app.\" Ware told lawmakers that There are better proposals that help keep kids safe without requiring millions of people to turn over their personal information,\" touting Apple's age assurance feature that \"allows a parent to share their child’s age range with an app developer, without having to share sensitive, specific information like a birthdate or government ID.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple has been fighting the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Accountability Act because of its privacy concerns, and because it does not want to be legally responsible for verifying user age, obtaining parental consent, or ensuring that developers follow the rules, nor does it want to collect the required documentation. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTo head off legislation, Apple has introduced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/27/apple-child-age-verification-overhaul/\">new age assurance features</a>, such as simpler tools for parents to oversee children's Apple accounts, new age categories for app content, and the Declared Age Range API that provides developers with a privacy-forward way to ensure kids aren't exposed to in-app content meant for adults.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple has argued that it already has extensive parental controls with Screen Time, and that the legislation would require it to collect excessive amounts of information from all users just to verify the age of children. Apple says that it could be required to collect data like a driver's license, passport, or Social Security number, which is \"not in the interest of user safety or privacy.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee will consider the bill on Thursday morning.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTexas <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/08/app-store-changes-texas-age-verification/\">recently passed</a> a similar bill, SB2420. Starting on January 1, 2026, Apple users located in Texas will need to confirm whether they are 18 years or older when creating an Apple Account. Apple will need to verify age and parental identity, and the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; will need to provide additional information to parents.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<b>Update:</b> This article was updated with additional information from Apple on Cook's remarks. <div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/10/tim-cook-age-verification-lobbying/\">Tim Cook Goes to Washington to Fight App Store Age Verification Legislation</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-goes-to-washington-to-fight-app-store-age-verification-legislation.2474486/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

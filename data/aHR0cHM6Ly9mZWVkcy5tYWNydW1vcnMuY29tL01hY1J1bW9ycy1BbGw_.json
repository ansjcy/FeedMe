      "content": "It looks like our first major Apple product announcements of 2026 are right around the corner, with Apple announcing a \"special Apple Experience\" for members of the media scheduled for March 4 where we're expecting to see them get hands-on time with several newly announced products.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/top-stories-2026-02-21.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1037050\" />\r<br/>\nIn other Apple news this week, the first betas of iOS 26.4 and related updates include some new features and enhancements, while we heard a bit more about the iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max coming later this year, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Top Stories</h2>\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Announces Special Event in New York, London, and Shanghai on March 4</h3>\r<br/>\nApple this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/apple-announces-special-event-in-new-york/\">invited members of the media to a \"special Apple Experience\"</a> taking place simultaneously in New York, London, and Shanghai on Wednesday, March 4.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Apple-Announces-Special-Event-in-New-York-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1888\" height=\"1063\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036546\" />\r<br/>\nRather than a traditional Apple event, it sounds like these \"experiences\" will be opportunities for the media to get hands-on time with a variety of products being announced at the start of or slightly before the event time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt actually sounds like we may be getting <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/apple-announcements-first-week-of-march/\">several days of press release announcements</a> in the first part of the week, culminating in the media experiences on Wednesday. While we don't know exactly what products will be announced that week, there are a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/apple-event-march-2026-preview/\">host of new products expected in the near future</a> including the iPhone 17e, M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro models, new iPads, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Everything New in iOS 26.4 Beta 1</h3>\r<br/>\nFollowing last week's release of iOS 26.3, Apple this week seeded the first betas of iOS 26.4 and related updates.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/iOS-26.4-Whats-New-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036532\" />\r<br/>\nWhile it doesn't include the more personalized Siri we had been hoping for, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-4-beta-features/\">there are a bunch of changes and new features</a> in the update.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOne of the more interesting changes being prepped for in the release is support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/ios-26-4-major-new-carplay-feature-revealed/\">CarPlay video over AirPlay</a>, which will allow users to stream Apple TV and other video content to their car's infotainment screen while their vehicle is parked.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Five iPhone 18 Pro Features Revealed in New Report</h3>\r<br/>\nWhile the iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max should have very similar designs to their predecessors, they are likely to be getting an array of new features and upgrades to attract customers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/Coffee-Burgundy-and-Purple-iPhone-18-Pro-Mock.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025606\" />\r<br/>\nResearch analyst Jeff Pu recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/five-iphone-18-pro-features-revealed-in-new-report/\">outlined five upgrades he's expecting to see</a> in the new models, and we've recapped a full list of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/reasons-to-wait-iphone-18-pro/\">ten reasons why you might want to wait</a> for the new models if you're considering buying now.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Reveals How Many iPhones Are Running iOS 26</h3>\r<br/>\nWith the transition to the controversial new Liquid Glass design in iOS 26, some users appear to have been holding off on upgrading, but new data released by Apple last week suggests the impact is relatively small.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/iOS-26-Glass-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1016183\" />\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/apple-shares-ios-26-adoption-stats/\">Apple adoption data</a> shows roughly the same share of devices are running iOS 26 at this point as were running iOS 18 a year ago, although the company did wait three weeks longer to release data this year. So while it appears adoption is lagging a bit this year, it's not a massive difference.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Toyota Rolling Out Apple Wallet Car Keys on iPhone</h3>\r<br/>\nToyota, the world's largest car manufacturer, is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/toyota-apple-wallet-car-keys/\">finally rolling out support for Apple's digital car key feature</a>, allowing users to lock, unlock, and start compatible vehicles from the Wallet app on their iPhone or Apple Watch.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Toyota-Rav4-Car-Key-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036635\" />\r<br/>\nSigns of the impending support were discovered back in December, and we've seen our first report of vehicles in the wild supporting it with the new 2026 RAV4.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Launching New 'Sales Coach' App</h3>\r<br/>\nApple plans to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/apple-launching-sales-coach-app/\">launch a rebranded \"Sales Coach\" app</a> on the iPhone and iPad later this month, according to a source familiar with the matter.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Apple-Sales-Coach-App.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036364\" />\r<br/>\n\"Sales Coach\" will arrive as an update to Apple's existing \"SEED\" app, and it will continue to provide sales tips and training resources to Apple Store and Apple Authorized Reseller employees around the world. For example, there are articles and videos highlighting everything from reasons to upgrade to a newer iPhone to popular iPad features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>MacRumors Newsletter</h2>\r<br/>\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/feb-19-2026\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/21/top-stories-apple-event-march-4/\">Top Stories: Apple Event on March 4, iOS 26.4 Beta, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-apple-event-on-march-4-ios-26-4-beta-and-more.2478017/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple has been developing a more affordable version of the MacBook, and it's rumored to be launching in under two weeks. This is going to be one of Apple's most unique Macs, because there hasn't really been anything quite like it before.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/Low-Cost-A18-Pro-MacBook-Feature-Pink.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028724\" />\r<br/>\nWe've rounded up everything we know about the low-cost MacBook ahead of its March debut.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Design</h2>\r<br/>\nRumors about the MacBook's design make it sound a lot like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>. It will have an aluminum chassis in various colors, and a 12.9-inch or 13-inch display, depending on the rumor.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Multicolored-Low-Cost-A18-Pro-MacBook-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036750\" />\r<br/>\nIt's possible the low-cost MacBook will have a thin and light design because it's going to use a lower power A-series chip that doesn't require a lot of heat dissipation, but that's not yet confirmed. Apple used to have a 12-inch MacBook with a thin design and a low-power Core M chip, and it's been suggested that this new MacBook could be something of a revival of that machine.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThinner and lighter typically means more expensive with Apple products, so a super slim design might not be what Apple is optimizing for. Making the low-cost MacBook thinner than the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; could just confuse the MacBook lineup.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWith the low-cost <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, Apple keeps the price down by using older display technology that's not as thin, so we could see that same strategy with the low-cost MacBook. A thicker chassis and a super efficient chip could mean a long battery life, which would be ideal for an educational environment.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Colors</h2>\r<br/>\nThe MacBook is going to come in a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/low-cost-macbook-yellow-green-blue-pink/\">selection of fun colors</a>, and Apple has tested light yellow, light green, blue, pink, silver, and dark gray, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>. Not all of those colors are likely to ship, but it sounds like we'll get at least four of them.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> thinks the MacBook will come in yellow, silver, blue, and pink, which would be the same colors that Apple offers for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>A-Series Chip</h2>\r<br/>\nThe most consistent rumor we've heard about the MacBook is its planned chip. Rather than an M-series Mac chip, Apple is planning to use an A-series chip. The low-cost MacBook is expected to use the A18 Pro chip, which Apple first debuted in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> Pro.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/A18-Pro-Chip.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-965379\" />\r<br/>\nThe A18 Pro uses a second-generation 3-nanometer process. It has a 6-core CPU with four performance cores and two efficiency cores, along with a 6-core GPU and a 16-core Neural Engine for AI-based tasks. In Geekbench benchmarks, the A18 Pro has an average single-core score of 3451, and a multi-core score of 8572. For comparison, the M4 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> earns a single-core score of 3694 and a multi-core score of 13732 (Apple's next &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is going to use the M4 chip).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe A18 Pro outperforms the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a>, which is the chip that Apple kept around in a lower-cost version of the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; for several years. An A18 MacBook wouldn't be too far off from the M4 Mac/&zwnj;iPad&zwnj; chips in terms of single-core performance, but there would be a difference in multi-core performance.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nA MacBook with the A18 chip would be more than powerful enough for day-to-day use like web browsing, document creation, watching videos, and even light photo and video editing. It won't be ideal for system-intensive games or tasks like 4K video editing and 3D rendering, but it will do almost everything an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; can do.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is developing the low-cost MacBook with students in mind, and it sounds like it will be the Apple equivalent of the affordable Chromebook PCs that are often used by students.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>RAM</h2>\r<br/>\nMacs start with 16GB RAM, but the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro has 8GB RAM, the minimum for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>. We can expect an A18 Pro MacBook to have at least 8GB RAM so it can support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, but it's possible Apple will give it the 16GB that all Macs have.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Storage</h2>\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; starts with 256GB of storage, but Apple could possibly launch the low-cost MacBook with 128GB.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Ports</h2>\r<br/>\nThe A18 Pro chip in the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro models doesn't support Thunderbolt, so the MacBook will be limited to USB-C (10GB/s) and won't offer Thunderbolt speeds. That will limit display connectivity, so it's likely the A18 Pro MacBook will only support a single external display.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Naming</h2>\r<br/>\nIt's not really clear what Apple will name the low-cost Mac notebook. We have the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>, so it's entirely possible it will be called \"MacBook.\" Apple has used the MacBook name multiple times in the past, and it's not in use at the moment.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Price</h2>\r<br/>\nPricing on the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; starts at &#36;999, and the low-cost MacBook is expected to be priced much lower.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple probably won't want to undercut its &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; pricing by too much. The low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; with A16 chip starts at &#36;349, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip starts at &#36;599. A price between &#36;599 and &#36;799 could make the most sense because it wouldn't be as expensive as the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, but would come in at or just over the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;'s cost.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&#36;599 would be on par with some of the highly rated Chromebook options that people often purchase for school use, while a &#36;699 or &#36;799 price would be in the same general pricing area, but a little more of a premium price tag. &#36;599 is also the cost of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a>, Apple's most affordable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that uses a slightly less powerful A18 chip.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Launch Date</h2>\r<br/>\nRumors suggest that the low-cost MacBook will be introduced at or just before Apple's March 4 Special Experience that's taking place in New York, London, and Shanghai. Apple could announce the MacBook in a press release ahead of the experience.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSelect members of the media have been invited to the mini event, and it's likely to provide them with a chance to try the new MacBook and other new devices.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/20/low-cost-macbook-latest-rumors/\">Apple&#039;s Low-Cost Colorful MacBook: All the Rumors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-low-cost-colorful-macbook-all-the-rumors.2478001/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "OpenAI is working on several AI hardware devices in partnership with former Apple designer Jony Ive, and the first product that comes out could be a smart speaker. The company is developing a smart speaker, a smart lamp, and considering AI glasses, according to <em><a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-openai-team-developing-ai-devices?rc=583sff\">The Information</a></em>, with the speaker set to come out in early 2027.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/jony-ive-sam-altman.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002771\" />\r<br/>\nOpenAI's smart speaker has an integrated camera and it is designed to learn information about who is using it and what's around them. It will include a facial recognition feature similar to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a>, and users will be able to use the speaker to make purchases. The speaker will have AI integration, so users can ask it questions and make requests.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn an internal presentation, OpenAI employees were told that the speaker would observe users and suggest actions to help them achieve goals, such as suggesting an early bedtime ahead of a morning meeting.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is working on a similar home hub device that's set to come out this year. The home hub will include an integrated camera and speaker for video calls and controlling smart home products, plus it will have deep integration with the updated version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> that Apple is developing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOpenAI is planning to price the speaker between &#36;200 and &#36;300, with a launch planned for February 2027 at the earliest. OpenAI is exploring a smart lamp and smart glasses, but those products won't be ready until 2028 or later. With the exception of the speaker, OpenAI's hardware development is in the early stages and other products could be canceled.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nJony Ive has been working with OpenAI since OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/21/openai-buys-jony-ive-ai-startup/\">acquired Ive's hardware firm</a> io in May 2025. Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have shared some details on their AI hardware work, suggesting that there was an established prototype <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/24/jony-ive-sam-altman-ai-device-2/\">in November 2025</a>. At the time, Ive and Altman said the device would be \"peaceful\" and an \"active participant\" that's not annoying. The duo also described the device as a product that would \"make people feel joy.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAdditional rumors about OpenAI's plans came following <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/details-leak-jony-ive-openai-device/\">an employee meeting</a>, where Ive and Altman said they didn't want a device with a screen. The device, which is presumably the speaker that <em>The Information</em> says is in development, was described as pocket-sized and contextually aware of the user's surroundings. Altman told employees it's \"the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhile Altman and Ive have promised the next big thing after the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, there is some internal tension at OpenAI. Ive's LoveFrom design company has remained separate from OpenAI, but LoveFrom is providing hardware designs to OpenAI. It's up to OpenAI's hardware and software engineers to actually make the products that LoveFrom comes up with.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOpenAI employees have apparently complained about LoveFrom's secrecy and slow speed when it comes to design revisions. Former Apple designer Evans Hankey is leading industrial design, and Ive is said to be making the final call on almost all design choices. Other former Apple employees working at OpenAI on hardware include Tang Tan and Scott Cannon, plus <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/\">Eddy Cue</a>'s son Adam Cue is working on OpenAI software.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jony-ive/\">Jony Ive</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lovefrom/\">LoveFrom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/\">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/20/jony-ive-openai-smart-speaker-2027/\">Jony Ive&#039;s First OpenAI Device Will Be Smart Speaker With Camera, 2027 Launch Planned</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/jony-ives-first-openai-device-will-be-smart-speaker-with-camera-2027-launch-planned.2477997/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

According to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris, the codenames were also present in updates such as macOS 26.2 and iOS 18.5 last year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/19/apple-event-invite-hint-new-macbook-colors/\">more</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/15/new-studio-display-or-pro-display-xdr-filing/\">more hints</a> stack up, it is clear that all three products are inching closer to release.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe prevailing assumption is that Apple will unveil the lower-cost MacBook as part of three days of new product announcements <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/apple-announcements-first-week-of-march/\">in the first week of March</a>. The media would then receive hands-on time with the laptop <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/apple-announces-special-event-in-new-york/\">during the \"Apple Experience\"</a> in New York, London, and Shanghai on Wednesday, March 4 at 9 a.m. Eastern Time.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe new Studio Displays are expected to be released <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/03/apple-studio-display-2-rumored-features/\">in the first half of 2026</a>, but it is unclear if they will be part of the announcements in the first week of March.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/mac-studio-and-studio-display.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"893\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-838875\" />\r<br/>\nThe lower-cost MacBook is rumored to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/\">powered by a version of the iPhone 16 Pro's A18 Pro chip</a>, rather than an M-series chip. The laptop will apparently be available in a variety of bright colors, such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/low-cost-macbook-yellow-green-blue-pink/\">yellow, green, blue, and/or pink</a>. Other rumored specs include a 12.9-inch display and 8GB of RAM. The starting price remains to be seen, with estimates ranging from &#36;599 to &#36;799 in the United States.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe lower-cost MacBook would be an all-new model positioned below the MacBook Air, and it would mark a revival of the \"MacBook\" brand (with no \"Air\" or \"Pro\" designation). Apple sold an Intel-based 12-inch \"MacBook\" <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/09/apple-discontinues-12-inch-macbook/\">from 2015 to 2019</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAt least one of the new Studio Display models is rumored to feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/\">27-inch screen with mini-LED backlighting</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/apple-studio-display-2-unusual-feature-rumor/\">up to a 90Hz</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/\">120Hz refresh rate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/\">HDR support</a>, and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/\">A19 chip</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/a19-pro-chip-coming-to-studio-display-2/\">A19 Pro chip</a>. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/09/apple-studio-display-2-latest-rumors/\">No major design changes</a> are expected.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf the next Studio Display receives mini-LED backlighting and HDR support, its maximum brightness and contrast ratio would be higher than the current model. And a newer A19 or A19 Pro chip — up from the A13 Bionic currently — should contribute to performance improvements, camera-related enhancements, and more.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThere are no details about the second Studio Display. Presumably, it would be a higher-end model, and we can only dream of a larger 32-inch screen size.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe current Studio Display launched in March 2022, alongside the first Mac Studio. It has a 27-inch screen without mini-LED backlighting, a 5K resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate, up to 600 nits brightness, a built-in camera and speakers, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB-C ports. In the U.S., pricing starts at &#36;1,599.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/\">Apple Studio Display</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/\">macOS Tahoe</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-a18-pro/\">MacBook (A18 Pro)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macworld-com/\">Macworld</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77\">Mac Accessories</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-tahoe.250\">macOS Tahoe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/20/macos-26-3-code-three-new-apple-products/\">Three Upcoming Apple Products Seemingly Spotted in macOS 26.3 Code</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/three-upcoming-apple-products-seemingly-spotted-in-macos-26-3-code.2477985/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

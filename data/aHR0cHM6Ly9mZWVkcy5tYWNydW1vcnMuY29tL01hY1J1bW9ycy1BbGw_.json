We've rounded up what we know about the next-generation &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; so far.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/mac-studio-green.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-901496\" />\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"design\">Design</h2>\r<br/>\nWe're not expecting Apple to redesign the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, and there haven't been rumors of a design update. The &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; will continue to have an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> or Mac mini-like squircle design with rounded corners.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; is a much more compact desktop than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a>, measuring in at 3.7 inches tall and 7.7 inches wide. Apple has apparently put the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; on the backburner, and the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; is seen as the future of Mac desktop computing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"m5_max_and_m5_ultra_chips\">M5 Max and M5 Ultra Chips</h2>\r<br/>\nWe're expecting the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; to adopt M5 Max and M5 Ultra chips. The M5 Max chip will offer much faster CPU and GPU performance than the M5 chip that came out last October, and the M5 Ultra will double the M5 Max performance.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSigns of the M5 Max and M5 Ultra chips were spotted in the recent <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/new-m5-chips-ios-26-3-beta/\">iOS 26.3 release candidate</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"faster_ssd\">Faster SSD</h2>\r<br/>\nThe M5 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> models were updated with a faster SSD, so the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; and other Macs coming in 2026 could get the same refresh.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"studio_display_2\">Studio Display 2</h2>\r<br/>\nApple debuted the first Studio Display alongside the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, and there is a new Studio Display 2 rumored to be coming this year. We could get the new display alongside the new &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Studio Display 2 is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-08/apple-readies-iphone-17e-new-siri-entry-level-ipad-ipad-air-and-macbook-pro-mldr3hpk\">expected to look like</a> the current model, but it could get a faster <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/apple-studio-display-2-unusual-feature-rumor/\">90Hz refresh rate</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/\">mini-LED display</a>, and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/a19-pro-chip-coming-to-studio-display-2/\">A19 chip</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h2>\r<br/>\nThere haven't been rumors of pricing increases for the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, so it could continue to start at &#36;1,999.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"release_timing\">Release Timing</h2>\r<br/>\nLast weekend, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> said that new &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; models \"shouldn't arrive too long after the spring Mac refresh,\" which is expected to include new &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNew &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models could come as early as the week of March 2, so the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; will come sometime after that date.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Neutral)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-studio-2026-rumors/\">What&#039;s Next for the Mac Studio</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whats-next-for-the-mac-studio.2477620/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple did not infringe on any patents owned by Texas-based company Optis Wireless, a jury ruled today. In a verdict shared by <em><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/apple-fends-off-4g-wireless-patent-lawsuit-third-trial-2026-02-12/\">Reuters</a></em>, the jury decided that Apple did not infringe any of the five LTE patents that Optis sued over back in 2019. If Optis had won, Apple could have faced hundreds of millions in damages.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001969\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iphone-16-pro-purple.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br/>\nOptis Wireless initially won &#36;506 million from Apple in a 2020 jury trial, but the damages were thrown out after Apple appealed because the jury didn't calculate damages with an understanding of fair and reasonable essential patent (FRAND) terms. A second jury trial was held in 2021 to recalculate damages, and the jury awarded Optis &#36;300 million. Apple again appealed, and the appeals court <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/17/apple-optis-patent-fight-appeals-win/\">vacated</a> the &#36;300 million verdict because the district court provided the jury with incorrect instructions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple and Optis were sent back to court for a third jury trial, which leads to today's verdict. With the jury finding in Apples favor, Apple owes Optis nothing. In a statement to <em>Reuters</em>, Apple said it was pleased the jury rejected Optis's infringement claims.\r<br/>\n<blockquote>\"We thank the jury for their time, and we're pleased they rejected Optis' false claims. Optis makes no products, and its sole business is to sue companies, which it has done repeatedly to Apple in an attempt to obtain an excessive payout.\"</blockquote>\r<br/>\nOptis is likely to appeal the ruling, sending it back to the appeals court again. Apple is also fighting Optis in the UK, where a UK court ordered Apple to pay &#36;502 million. Apple appealed the decision and the UK Supreme Court will hear the case in June 2026.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent-lawsuits/\">Patent Lawsuits</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent-trials/\">Patent Trials</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/12/apple-optis-patent-trial-win/\">Apple Wins Third Jury Trial Against Optis, Avoiding Hundreds of Millions in Patent Damages</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wins-third-jury-trial-against-optis-avoiding-hundreds-of-millions-in-patent-damages.2477619/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Apple's statement comes just a day after <em>Bloomberg</em> reported Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/siri-features-delayed-ios-26-4/\">is having issues</a> with the updated version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, leading to potential delays of the feature.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/Finder-Siri-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1014637\" />\r<br/>\nApple initially intended to launch the Apple Intelligence-powered version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; in spring 2025, but right around when a debut was expected in March 2025, Apple said that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/\">Siri wasn't ready</a> and needed more time. Later in the year, Apple said that it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/apple-says-personalized-siri-was-working/\">would launch its Siri update</a> in 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThough Apple never gave a timeline more specific than \"2026,\" <em>Bloomberg</em> said the company was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/apple-intelligence-siri-spring-2026/\">aiming to include Siri</a> in iOS 26.4, an update planned for spring 2026. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s latest report suggests the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality will not be ready in time to be included in iOS 26.4, so the new features could be pushed to iOS 26.5 or iOS 27.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple may miss its internal target for the 2026 &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; launch, but since the company never publicly gave timing beyond 2026, there's no actual delay yet. Apple has until December 2026 to launch &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; within the timeframe that it promised in summer of 2025.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBack in June 2024, Apple previewed three new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features, including onscreen awareness, personal context, and the ability to do more in and between apps. Apple has since started working on additional &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features like image generation and a tool for searching the web.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn Apple's testing, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; apparently sometimes doesn't process queries properly, and can take too long to respond to requests. Features are not working as intended, so &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s new capabilities could roll out across several updates. We could still get one or two new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features in iOS 26.4, with other features set to come in future updates slated for 2026. There are still several <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a> updates planned for 2026, and iOS 27 will launch in September 2026.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple provided <em>CNBC</em> with a statement because the company's stock dropped five percent today, both due to the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; delay rumors and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/12/tim-cook-faces-ftc-warning-apple-news/\">FTC scrutiny over Apple News</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is likely to release the first beta of iOS 26.4 later this month, giving us more insight into the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; launch situation.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/12/siri-ios-26-launch-confirmed-apple/\">Apple Confirms Revamped Siri is Still Coming in 2026</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-confirms-revamped-siri-is-still-coming-in-2026.2477617/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Sony <a href=\"https://howl.link/n92jnco8kj42u\">today announced</a> a new set of earbuds that are designed to compete with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro 3</a>. The &#36;330 WF-1000XM6 Truly Wireless Earbuds feature Active Noise Cancellation with a 25 percent reduction in noise compared to the prior-generation XM5 earbuds, with improved performance in the mid-to-high frequency range that's common in everyday environments.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/sony-earbuds-xm6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"674\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036197\" />\r<br/>\nThe earbuds use Sony's HD Noise Canceling Processor QN3e with an adaptive noise canceling optimizer and four microphones on each earbud to detect sound to cut out. The earbuds analyze external noise and wearing conditions in real time to improve noise canceling performance.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSony's XM6 earbuds are smaller than the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; because there is no stem, and they include noise isolating silicone ear tips with a USB-C charging case. Sony redesigned the earbuds with a more ergonomic shape that's meant to follow the natural curves of the inner ear to reduce discomfort, and the XM6 is 11 percent slimmer than the XM5. The updated design also reduces internal noises like footsteps and chewing sounds.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe battery in the XM6 earbuds lasts for up to eight hours, and the charging case provides an additional 24 hours.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMore processing power delivers better sound, and Sony says the earbuds have a new driver unit that combines different materials on the dome and the edge. The soft edge offers deep bass, while the rigid dome provides clear and extended high frequencies. Sony is also using AI to restore compressed files in real time to improve sound quality.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor phone calls, there are two microphones and a bone conduction sensor on each side, with the earbuds using AI beamforming to isolate and capture the wearer's voice even in crowded environments.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSony offers Adaptive Sound Control, Auto Play, multi-device support, and integrated voice assistance, with Google Gemini Live built in.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nReviews suggest the WF-1000XM6 earbuds are almost on par with the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; when it comes to noise cancellation. According to <em><a href=\"https://www.soundguys.com/sony-wf-1000xm6-review-152013/\">SoundGuys</a></em>, the XM6 had an 88 percent average reduction in loudness across all frequencies, just behind the 90 percent average of the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj;. Passive isolation was better than the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; passive sound reduction.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wf-1000xm6-review-facing-tougher-competition-160000652.html\">Engadget</a></em> felt that Sony's earbuds struggled with human voices and had fit issues, but <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/877503/sony-wf-1000xm6-earbuds-review\">The Verge</a></em> said the earbuds tuned out conversations better than other ANC earbuds, including the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/audio/earbuds-airpods/sony-wf-1000xm6-review\">TechRadar</a></em> said the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; had noticeably better ANC, <em><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/sony-wf-1000xm6-earbuds-review\">Business Insider</a></em> preferred the XM6 noise canceling, and <em><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/sony-wf-1000xm6-earbuds-review/\">CNET</a></em> said the XM6 offered better sound quality than the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSony's new earbuds are <a href=\"https://howl.link/n92jnco8kj42u\">available from the Sony website</a> for &#36;330.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sony/\">Sony</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/12/sony-wf-1000xm6-earbuds/\">Sony Launches &#36;330 WF-1000XM6 Earbuds to Take on AirPods Pro 3</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sony-launches-330-wf-1000xm6-earbuds-to-take-on-airpods-pro-3.2477614/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "In watchOS 26, the Smart Stack for your Apple Watch is pretty clever. The collection of widgets can be pulled up with a scroll of the Digital Crown, and shows you relevant information throughout your day. But sometimes, its eagerness to help can be a bit much, especially when it comes to Live Activities.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/live-activities-watch.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-980591\" />\r<br/>\nYou're probably familiar with this scenario: You raise your wrist expecting to see your customized watch face, but it's been replaced by media playback controls because someone's watching your Apple TV, or a timer you set earlier for cooking that still has ages left to run. Live Activities in the Smart Stack can clearly be useful, but having them automatically take over your display isn't always ideal. Here's how to take back control:\r<br/>\n<ol>\r<br/>\n  <li>Open Settings on your Apple Watch.</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Tap <strong>Smart Stack</strong>.</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Select <strong>Live Activities</strong>.</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Toggle off the switch next to <strong>Auto-Launch Live Activities</strong>.</li>\r<br/>\n</ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/live-activities-apple-watch-watchos26.jpeg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036152\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAfter disabling auto-launch, Live Activities will still be available in your Smart Stack when you want them – you'll just need to manually scroll to see them instead of having them pop up automatically.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf you want more granular control, you're in luck. From the same settings screen you can control which Apple apps display Live Activities. Using the Watch app on your iPhone, you can also manage Live Activities settings for third-party apps. This lets you keep the notifications you find useful while preventing the less important ones from interrupting your watch face.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPro Tip: If it's just those persistent media controls that bug you, head to <strong>Media Apps</strong> in the same settings menu and turn off <strong>Live Activities</strong> completely, or alternatively under \"Auto-Launch,\" select <strong>Off</strong> or <strong>Smart Stack</strong> for a more focused watch face experience.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/apple-watch-live-activities-fix/\">Live Activities Taking Over Your Apple Watch?

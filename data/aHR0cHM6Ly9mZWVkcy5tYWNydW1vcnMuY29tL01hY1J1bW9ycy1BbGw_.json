      "content": "Apple has sent out invites to select creators for an \"Apple Experience\" in Los Angeles, California, scheduled for January 27 to 29. The event has sparked speculation that Apple will also announce new MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/creators-studio-event-LA.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1033394\" />\r<br/>\nCreator Petr Mara <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTNCKGSjMQ9/\">shared an image</a> of his invite on Instagram on January 7, but it appears to have only now gained significant traction on social media platforms. Mara was also invited to an Apple event in September to test out the latest iPhone 17 Pro models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's new Creator Studio bundle of creative apps, announced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/apple-creator-studio/\">last week</a>, launches on Wednesday, January 28, so this event is surely related. Given the bundle includes several professional Mac apps, such as Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, and Pixelmator Pro, there's a good chance that Apple will use the coinciding event as an opportunity to release new MacBook Pro models too.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlso, Apple's next quarterly earnings call is scheduled for Thursday, January 29, and the company has introduced new products shortly before these calls on several occasions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple in October updated the base 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M5 chip, so the higher-end models are due an upgrade. Beyond the processor, the only other notable change to the base model was PCIe 5.0 storage. According to Apple, this delivers up to twice the SSD read and write speeds of the previous generation.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/23/apple-invites-creators-la-event-jan-27-29/\">Apple Hosting LA Event for Creators on January 27-29 That Could Coincide With MacBook Pro Announcement</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-hosting-la-event-for-creators-on-january-27-29-that-could-coincide-with-macbook-pro-announcement.2476492/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Specifically, they said it will have a width of around 13.5mm, down from around 20.7mm, and they shared the mockup image above to show what it would look like.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAn earlier report from <em>The Information</em> indicated that the iPhone 18 Pro models will feature under-screen Face ID. As a result, the publication said the devices would have only a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-18-pro-under-screen-face-id-rumor/\">hole-punch front camera in the top-left corner of the screen</a>, rather than the current pill-shaped cutout for the front camera and Face ID sensors. However, the latest word is that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/20/iphone-18-pro-leak-smaller-dynamic-island/\">only Face ID's flood illuminator will be moved under the screen</a> this year, meaning that Apple will only be able to shrink the pill-shaped cutout rather than remove it entirely.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAccording to display industry expert Ross Young, who has a very good track record, the smaller Dynamic Island will <a href=\"https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/2013829835856965977\">last through at least 2027</a>. So, it could take at least a few more years until the iPhone finally gets a truly seamless display.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"Ice Universe\" has leaked some accurate iPhone dimensions in the past, giving them credibility, but they do not have a perfect track record.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple is expected to unveil the iPhone 18 Pro models in September.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/\">iPhone 18</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ice-universe/\">Ice Universe</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/23/iphone-18-pro-alleged-dynamic-island-size/\">iPhone 18 Pro: Leaker Reveals Alleged Size of Smaller Dynamic Island</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-18-pro-leaker-reveals-alleged-size-of-smaller-dynamic-island.2476483/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Apple allows for app marketplaces in the EU because of the Digital Markets Act, which is policed by the European Commission.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe European Commission is gearing up to blame Apple for Setapp's EU shutdown, according to information viewed by <em>Bloomberg</em>. \"Apple has not rolled out changes to address the key issues concerning its business terms, including their complexity,\" the EC reportedly plans to say.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple says that it has not simplified its EU business terms as expected because of the European Commission's refusal to let it implement the changes.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple further claims that there is little demand for alternative app marketplaces in Europe, and the company said that it is not the reason that Setapp is shutting down.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/\">European Commission</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/22/apple-europe-political-delay-tactics/\">Apple Accuses European Commission of &#039;Political Delay Tactics&#039; Over App Store Changes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-accuses-european-commission-of-political-delay-tactics-over-app-store-changes.2476473/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

Second, it noted that meteorologists caution that it can be difficult to forecast specific precipitation amounts several days in advance of a storm.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs this system approaches, snowfall estimates shown in the Apple Weather app have decreased in many cities compared to what was originally forecasted, but the amounts remain significant in many areas.

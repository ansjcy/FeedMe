      "content": "Apple is planning to upgrade <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> twice in the coming year, adding personalization features in iOS 26.4 before turning the personal assistant into a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/siri-chatbot-ios-27/\">full chatbot in iOS 27</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/Finder-Siri-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1014637\" />\r<br/>\nAs long as timelines don't change, we'll see the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot as soon as June 2026. Here's everything we know so far.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"siribot\">SiriBot</h2>\r<br/>\nWith iOS 27, Apple will change the way that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; works. Right now, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can answer basic questions and complete simple tasks, but you can't engage it in a back and forth conversation, get help with multi-step tasks, or ask complicated questions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBased on the current &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot rumors, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to do all of that and more with the upcoming upgrade, and it will work like competing chatbots.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt3qAWxIbrU\">wasn't initially planning</a> to introduce a full chatbot that users can interact with similarly to Claude or ChatGPT, but chatbots have become too popular for Apple to ignore. Simply adding AI capabilities to apps and features isn't enough for Apple to stay competitive with the way people have embraced chatbots for everything from web searches to coding help.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGoogle has already integrated Gemini into a range of Android devices, and chatbots like ChatGPT have hundreds of millions of weekly active users.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"siri_capabilities\">Siri Capabilities</h2>\r<br/>\nAccording to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s chatbot capabilities will be \"embedded deeply\" into Apple's products at the system level. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; won't be an app, but will instead be integrated into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS like &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is now.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"siri_activation_and_interface\">Siri Activation and Interface</h2>\r<br/>\nUsers will activate &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; in the same way they do today, speaking the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; wake word or pressing on the side button of a Siri-enabled device. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to respond to both voice and text-based requests.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe don't yet know what the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; interface will look like. Apple will need to make big changes to the way that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; looks and feels if it wants to match functionality offered by companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPeople are used to opening up an app and having a full text interface that includes conversation history, and it's not clear how Apple will provide that if there's no dedicated &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot app. People will want to be able to access their past conversations and have tools for uploading files and images.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt's possible activating &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; could lead to an app-like interface that takes over the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, or Mac's display, but that will be a departure from &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s current minimalistic design. Apple could alternatively log conversations in a place like the Notes app, or in the clipboard on the Mac.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGurman says that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; won't be an app, but that might mean that it won't <em>only</em> be an app. There could be some kind of dedicated chatbot app that people can use, with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; also able to be activated and used on a system level and in and across apps.\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"what_siri_chatbot_can_do\">What Siri Chatbot Can Do</h2>\r<br/>\nIt sounds like the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot will be able to do everything that current chatbots can do, and more.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n <li>Search the web for information</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Generate images</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Generate content</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Summarize information</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Analyze uploaded files</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Use personal data to complete tasks</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Ingest information from emails, messages, files and more</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Analyze open windows and on-screen content to take action</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Control device features and settings</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Search for on-device content, replacing Spotlight</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\n&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will also be integrated into Apple's core apps, including Mail, Messages, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, Xcode, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a>. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to search for specific images, edit photos, help with coding, make suggestions for TV shows and movies, and send emails.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"ios_26.4_llm_siri_vs._chatbot_siri\">iOS 26.4 \"LLM Siri\" vs. Chatbot Siri</h2>\r<br/>\nIn iOS 26.4, Apple plans to introduce a new, updated version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that relies on large language models, or LLMs. Apple has been working on this version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> features were added to iOS 18, but it was delayed because &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s underlying architecture needed an overhaul to run LLMs.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nStarting in iOS 26.4, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to hold continuous conversations and provide human-like responses to questions, plus &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will have new personalization features that will let it do more than before. What &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; won't have, though, is full chatbot capabilities. Here's what we're expecting:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"personal_context\">Personal Context</h3>\r<br/>\nWith personal context, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to keep track of emails, messages, files, photos, and more, learning more about you to help you complete tasks and keep track of what you've been sent.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n <li>Show me the files Eric sent me last week.</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Find the email where Eric mentioned ice skating.</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Find the books that Eric recommended to me.</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Where's the recipe that Eric sent me?</li>\r<br/>\n <li>What's my passport number?</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"onscreen_awareness\">Onscreen Awareness</h3>\r<br/>\nOnscreen awareness will let &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; see what's on your screen and complete actions involving whatever you're looking at. If someone texts you an address, for example, you can tell &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to add it to their contact card. Or if you're looking at a photo and want to send it to someone, you can ask &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to do it for you.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3 id=\"deeper_app_integration\">Deeper App Integration</h3>\r<br/>\nDeeper app integration means that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to do more in and across apps, performing actions and completing tasks that are just not possible with the personal assistant right now. We don't have a full picture of what &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be capable of, but Apple has provided a few examples of what to expect.\r<br/>\n<ul>\r<br/>\n <li>Moving files from one app to another.</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Editing a photo and then sending it to someone.</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Get directions home and share the ETA with Eric.</li>\r<br/>\n <li>Send the email I drafted to Eric.</li>\r<br/>\n</ul>\r<br/>\nYou're not going to have a chat-like interface for back-and-forth conversations with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; when iOS 26.4 launches, but the personal assistant should be very different than it is now. Apple software engineering chief Craig Federighi told employees last summer that the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; revamp was successful. \"This has put us in a position to not just deliver what we announced, but to deliver a much bigger upgrade than that we envisioned,\" he said.\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"siri_redesign\">Siri Redesign</h2>\r<br/>\nWith all of the new functionality coming to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, Apple is planning to make visual design changes. It's not quite clear what that will entail, but for the upcoming table-top robot that's in the works, Apple has tested an animated version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that looks similar to the Mac's Finder logo.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple could start rolling out that new, more personalized design when &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; gets the major iOS 27 revamp.\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"memory\">Memory</h2>\r<br/>\nClaude, ChatGPT, and Gemini can remember past conversations and interactions, retaining a memory of the user. Apple is said to be discussing how much the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot will be able to remember.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple may limit conversational memory to protect user privacy.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"naming\">Naming</h2>\r<br/>\n&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is getting a major overhaul, but Apple will probably continue to refer to it as &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. It'll just be a much smarter version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"underlying_architecture_and_servers\">Underlying Architecture and Servers</h2>\r<br/>\nApple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/google-gemini-future-apple-intelligence-features/\">inked a deal with Google</a> that will see Gemini powering upcoming versions of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. Apple plans to use Gemini for the iOS 26.4 updates that it is introducing, and Google's technology will also power the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"Apple and Google have entered into a multi-year collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be based on Google's Gemini models and cloud technology,\" the two companies said in a statement in January.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot specifically will rely on a custom AI model developed by the Google Gemini team. Gurman claims that the custom model is comparable to Gemini 3, and that it will be much more powerful than the model behind Apple's upcoming iOS 26.4 features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple and Google are also discussing running the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot on Google's servers powered by Tensor Processing Units, probably because Apple doesn't yet have the infrastructure to handle chatbot queries from billions of active devices per day.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn the future, Apple will be able to transition &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to a different underlying model, so when the company does have in-house LLMs powerful enough to compete with ChatGPT or Gemini, it can move away from Google. Apple will also potentially be able to offer chatbot capabilities in China by partnering with a Chinese AI company.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nChina restricts foreign companies from offering AI features in the country.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"platforms\">Platforms</h2>\r<br/>\n&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s chatbot functionality will be the key new feature in iOS 27, iPadOS 27, and macOS 27, and &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s capabilities will be integrated into the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and Mac. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot features could also come to other platforms like visionOS and tvOS.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"cost\">Cost</h2>\r<br/>\nThere is no word yet on whether <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/will-apple-charge-for-its-siri-chatbot/\">there will be some kind of fee</a> associated with the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot. The &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot won't be able to run entirely on device, and Apple is going to need major cloud processing power. Without taking into account any development or hosting costs, Apple is paying Google approximately &#36;1 billion per year for access to Google's models.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCompanies like Google and OpenAI spend billions on infrastructure and compute costs each year, and no AI service is entirely free. Apple will likely need to charge something, but it could do what Google has done with Gemini.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGoogle offers a free version of Gemini on Pixel smartphones and other Android devices that have integrated AI. The basic version of Gemini is able to answer questions, summarize text, write emails, and control apps and smartphone features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAndroid users can pay &#36;20 per month for Gemini Advanced to get access to the more advanced version of Gemini that offers better reasoning, longer context for analyzing bigger documents, and improved coding.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2 id=\"launch_date\">Launch Date</h2>\r<br/>\nApple is planning to introduce &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s chatbot capabilities when it announces iOS 27, iPadOS 27, and macOS 27 at the June Worldwide Developers Conference. If the chatbot features aren't ready to go, Apple will likely hold off on showing off the new functionality because of the major mistake it made with iOS 18 and &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot is expected to be introduced in the new updates in September after several months of beta testing.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri-chatbot/\">Apple&#039;s Siri Chatbot in iOS 27: Everything We Know</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-siri-chatbot-in-ios-27-everything-we-know.2476534/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The new capabilities will include better understanding of a user's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls, but some of this functionality <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/google-gemini-siri-capabilities-report/\">might not be available until iOS 27</a> later this year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor example, all the way back at WWDC 2024, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info retrieved from the Mail and Messages apps.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLooking ahead, Apple is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/siri-chatbot-ios-27/\">planning to launch a full-out Siri chatbot on iOS 27</a>, allowing users to have ChatGPT-like conversations with Siri. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>New Emoji</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iOS-26-Emoji-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2331\" height=\"1311\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1011195\" />\r<br/>\nLast year, the Unicode Consortium <a href=\"https://blog.unicode.org/2025/07/say-hello-to-new-emoji-coming-in.html\">previewed</a> some of the new emoji that are expected to be added to the iPhone with iOS 26.4.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHere are nine of the new emoji:<ul><li>Trombone</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Treasure Chest</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Distorted Face</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Hairy Creature (aka Bigfoot or Sasquatch)</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Fight Cloud</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Apple Core</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Orca</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Ballet Dancers</li>\r<br/>\n  <li>Landslide</li></ul>Apple most recently added new emoji to the iPhone <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/03/ios-18-4-emoji/\">with iOS 18.4</a>, an update that came out in March last year. iOS 17.4, iOS 16.4, and iOS 15.4 also introduced new emoji over the years, so the timing has become predictable by this point.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>More</h2>\r<br/>\n<em>Macworld</em>'s Filipe Espósito last month leaked some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/12/alleged-ios-26-4-and-ios-27-features/\">other potential iOS 26.4 features</a>:<ul><li>If you have credit card information stored in Apple's Passwords app, you will be able to AutoFill those details in third-party apps.</li>\r<br/>\n<li>You will be able to create folders in the Freeform app.</li>\r<br/>\n<li>Apple is apparently working on a new sports tier for the Apple TV app, but the report did not offer any further details about this.</li>\r<br/>\n<li>There are signs of \"a new validation system that will check the integrity of the device before logging into Apple ID and iCloud.\"</li>\r<br/>\n<li>A new \"Precise Outdoor Location\" feature for AirPods in the Find My app.</li></ul>Of course, there will be additional iOS 26.4 features that are still unknown, so stay tuned.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/\">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248\">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/23/what-to-expect-from-ios-26-4/\">What to Expect From iOS 26.4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-ios-26-4.2476530/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

The current fee is 1.5 percent of the transaction amount, with the same &#36;0.25 minimum fee and a lower &#36;15 maximum fee.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUsing Instant Transfer to deposit &#36;1,000 from Apple Cash to a bank account currently requires users to pay a &#36;15 fee, for example, but that will increase to &#36;17 after February 18.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAn ACH transfer that takes one to three business days will continue to have no fee, and that is always an option for Apple Cash users.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTransferring money from Apple Cash to a bank account can be done by choosing the Apple Cash card in the Wallet app, tapping on the three-dot more button, and then selecting the Transfer to Bank option.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple Cash continues to be limited to the United States. It can be used to send and receive money from friends and contacts right in the Messages app as an alternative to services like Venmo, Zelle, or PayPal.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-cash/\">Apple Cash</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/23/apple-cash-instant-transfer-fee-increase/\">Apple Cash Instant Transfer Fees Are Going Up Soon</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-cash-instant-transfer-fees-are-going-up-soon.2476528/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "In an email to developers this week, Apple indicated that it will begin showing additional ads in App Store search results starting Tuesday, March 3.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/App-Store-Ad-Slot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1222\" height=\"687\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1033504\" />\r<br/>\nThe extra ads will first appear in the App Store in the U.K. and Japan, followed by other markets like the U.S. by the end of March, according to Apple.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple first announced that it would be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/18/app-store-search-results-more-ads-2026/\">expanding the number of ad slots</a> in the App Store search results last month, but it had not provided an exact date for the change until now. Currently, developers can only pay to have an app appear in a single slot at the top of the search results, but Apple said there will now be multiple slots further down.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple shared more details <a href=\"https://ads.apple.com/app-store/help/ad-placements/0082-search-results\">on its website</a>:<blockquote>Search is the way most people find and download apps on the App Store, with nearly 65 percent of downloads happening directly after a search. To help give advertisers more opportunities to drive downloads from search results, Apple Ads will introduce additional ads across search queries. The additional ads will roll out in phases, appearing across all markets by the end of March. You don't need to change your campaign in order to be eligible for any new positions. Your ad will run in either the existing position — at the top of search results — or further down in search results. If you have a search results campaign running, your ad will be automatically eligible for all available positions, but you can't select or bid for a particular one.</blockquote>Additional ads equals additional services revenue for Apple.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe extra ad slots will be visible on iPhone and iPad devices running iOS 26.2 or iPadOS 26.2 and later. Apps with paid placement have an \"Ad\" label.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAds are also shown in the App Store's \"Today\" tab, in a \"You Might Also Like\" section at the bottom of individual app listings, and in the search tab's \"Suggested\" section. Apple rebranded its \"Search Ads\" business as \"<a href=\"https://ads.apple.com/\">Apple Ads</a>\" last year, as it reportedly prepares to begin showing ads in more places, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/26/apple-moving-ahead-with-ads-in-maps/\">such as Apple Maps</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/\">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/23/more-app-store-ads-coming-soon/\">Apple to Show More Ads in App Store Starting in March</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-show-more-ads-in-app-store-starting-in-march.2476523/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

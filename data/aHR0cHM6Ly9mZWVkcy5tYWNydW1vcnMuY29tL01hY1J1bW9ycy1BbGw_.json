      "content": "We have our first Apple product announcement of 2026, and it's a software subscription known as Apple Creator Studio featuring Apple's video, audio, and image editing apps, as well as some AI-powered features and premium content for iWork apps and Freeform.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/top-stories-2026-01-17.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032578\" />\r<br/>\nIn other news this week, Apple made it official that next-generation Siri will leverage Google Gemini, while we got the second round of betas for iOS 26.3 and other updates, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Top Stories</h2>\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Introduces New 'Creator Studio' Bundle of Apps for &#36;129 Per Year</h3>\r<br/>\nApple this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/apple-creator-studio/\">introduced a new Apple Creator Studio bundle</a> that offers access to six creative apps, as well as exclusive AI features and content, as part of a single subscription. In the U.S., pricing is set at &#36;12.99 per month or &#36;129 per year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/Apple-Creator-Studio.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032006\" />\r<br/>\nApps in the bundle include Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, and Pixelmator Pro for both Mac and iPad, plus Motion, Compressor, and MainStage on Mac. It also includes some premium content and features for Pages, Numbers, Keynote, and Freeform.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs noted, Pixelmator Pro for iPad is included in Apple Creator Studio, and that's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/pixelmator-pro-is-coming-to-ipad/\">a new app making its way from the Mac to a tablet-optimized experience</a>. The existing basic Pixelmator app for iPhone and iPad will, however, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/pixelmator-no-longer-being-updated/\">no longer be updated</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple will continue to offer standalone versions of its pro apps alongside the Creator Studio subscription option, but some content and perhaps some new features <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/apple-creator-studio-exclusive-app-features/\">may not come to the standalone versions</a>, though they <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/14/final-cut-pro-one-time-vs-creator-studio/\">will continue to be updated and receive at least some new features</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Confirms Google Gemini Will Power Next-Generation Siri This Year</h3>\r<br/>\nApple and Google this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/google-gemini-next-generation-siri/\">confirmed that Google Gemini will power the next-generation version of Siri</a> that is slated to launch later this year. \"After careful evaluation, we determined that Google's technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we're excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,\" the statement said.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/siri-gemini-iphone.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032574\" />\r<br/>\nIt appears the partnership, which is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/15/apple-google-gemini-deal-5-billion/\">reportedly worth billions of dollars</a>, will extend beyond <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/google-gemini-siri-capabilities-report/\">next-generation Siri</a>, with the companies noting the models will \"help power future Apple Intelligence features\" including Siri.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Apple Is Expected to Launch These Four MacBooks in 2026</h3>\r<br/>\n2026 could be a bumper year for Apple's Mac lineup, with the company expected to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/09/apple-launch-four-macbooks-2026/\">announce as many as four separate MacBook launches</a>. Rumors suggest Apple will court both ends of the consumer spectrum, with more affordable options for students and feature-rich premium lines for users that seek the highest specifications from a laptop.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/2026-macbooks-thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031909\" />\r<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/09/apple-launch-four-macbooks-2026/\">Check out our overview of everything we might see</a> in the MacBook lineup this year, with some speculating we <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/14/macbook-pro-january/\">could see the first of the releases before the end of this month</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Here's What's New in iOS 26.3 So Far</h3>\r<br/>\nFollowing a holiday break, Apple this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/apple-seeds-ios-26-3-beta-2/\">seeded a second round of betas for iOS 26.3</a> and related operating system updates. Among the most notable changes in the latest iOS 26.3 is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/encryption-rcs-messages-latest-ios-beta/\">new references to end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for RCS messages</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/iOS-26.3-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029939\" />\r<br/>\nSupport for E2EE on RCS would seemingly be part of a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/ios-26-rcs-3-future-benefits/\">larger upgrade to RCS messaging on Apple platforms</a> that would bring the texting experience closer to that of iMessage with several new features.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBeyond potential RCS changes, be sure to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/ios-26-3-new-features/\">check out our full list of everything new in iOS 26.3 so far</a>. We're expecting a public release around the end of this month.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>Verizon Goes Down: iPhones Show 'SOS' Mode Due to Network Outage</h3>\r<br/>\nVerizon <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/14/verizon-is-down-iphone-sos/\">experienced a major outage across the U.S. on Wednesday</a>, with hundreds of thousands of customers reporting issues with the network on the website Downdetector. There were also numerous complaints across Reddit and other social media platforms.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/Verizon-New.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032312\" />\r<br/>\nThe outage lasted for many hours, with Verizon <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/14/iphone-sos-verizon-apologizes/\">issuing an apology</a> as service started to come back online. Affected customers <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/15/verizon-20-dollars-credit/\">can redeem a &#36;20 credit</a> as part of the apology.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h3>New Leak Reveals iPhone 18 Pro Display Sizes, Under-Screen Face ID, and More</h3>\r<br/>\nWhile the iPhone 18 Pro models are still around eight months away, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/14/iphone-18-pro-sizes-under-screen-face-id-rumors/\">leaker has shared some alleged details about the devices</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iPhone-Top-Left-Hole-Punch-Face-ID-Feature-Purple.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000739\" />\r<br/>\nIn a post on Chinese social media platform Weibo this week, the account Digital Chat Station said the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max will have the same 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch display sizes as the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. Consistent with previous rumors, the leaker claimed that both of the models will have a breakthrough new feature: under-screen Face ID.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs for the standard iPhone 18 and the iPhone Air 2, the leaker expects those devices to have a Dynamic Island, and the same 6.3-inch and 6.5-inch display sizes as the equivalent previous-generation models, respectively.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>MacRumors Newsletter</h2>\r<br/>\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/jan-15-2026\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/17/top-stories-apple-creator-studio/\">Top Stories: Apple Creator Studio, Google Gemini-Powered Siri, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-apple-creator-studio-google-gemini-powered-siri-and-more.2476178/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

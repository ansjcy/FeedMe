      "content": "Apple has confirmed that it will continue to offer a one-time-purchase version of Final Cut Pro for Mac for &#36;299.99, but will that version receive every new feature?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/Final-Cut-Pro-Mac-Display.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1120\" height=\"630\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032350\" />\r<br/>\nIn an interview <a href=\"https://www.cined.com/apple-creator-studio-cined-exclusive-interview-reveals-the-future-of-pro-apps-licensing/\">with digital filmmaking news website <em>CineD</em></a>, Apple marketing manager Bryan O'Neil Hughes said both the one-time-purchase and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/apple-creator-studio/\">Apple Creator Studio</a> versions of Final Cut Pro for Mac will include the new \"intelligent\" features Visual Search, Transcript Search, and Beat Detection, but his comment did not explicitly confirm if both versions of the app will receive <strong>every</strong> additional \"intelligent\" feature in the future. We have reached out to Apple for comment, and we will update this story if we receive a response.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhat we do know is that the one-time-purchase version of Final Cut Pro for Mac will miss out on some \"premium content,\" according to Apple's website:<blockquote>A one-time purchase will still be available, but access to some of the premium content is available only to Apple Creator Studio subscribers. If you already own Final Cut Pro, it will continue to be updated.</blockquote>In the interview, Hughes went on say that both the one-time-purchase and Creator Studio versions of Final Cut Pro for Mac will continue to receive updates and \"work as you expect,\" but we have still yet to see Apple explicitly confirm if both versions of the Mac app will have 100% feature parity forever. For now, though, it seems like customers with the one-time-purchase version will only miss out on \"premium content.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple's website is more explicit about Logic Pro and MainStage, promising feature parity:<blockquote>Logic Pro and MainStage have all the same features whether they are subscription or one-time-purchase versions.</blockquote>Some other apps in the Creator Studio bundle, including Pixelmator Pro, Keynote, Numbers, Pages, and Freeform, will be receiving some \"intelligent\" features that will not be available without a subscription, so it is a mixed bag.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor example, only Pixelmator Pro users with a Creator Studio subscription will be receiving a new Warp tool that allows you to twist and shape image layers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAcross the Keynote, Pages, and Numbers apps, Creator Studio subscribers will have access to a new Content Hub with high-quality photos and graphics, as well as new premium templates, themes, and more. Apple said its Freeform app will also be updated with \"intelligent\" features for Creator Studio subscribers later this year.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nKeynote, Numbers, Pages, and Freeform do not cost money, but the apps will effectively be \"freemium\" now. Fortunately, Apple has ensured that all four of the apps will continue to receive other new features and updates without a subscription.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOverall, the introduction of the Creator Studio bundle makes for a more confusing landscape with less feature parity in some apps, and customers who dislike subscriptions have been voicing their disappointment. Keeping one-time purchase options around helps alleviate some concerns, but not everyone is happy with this direction.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple Creator Studio launches on Wednesday, January 28, with U.S. pricing set at &#36;12.99 per month or &#36;129.99 per year — read our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/apple-creator-studio/\">earlier coverage</a> to learn more.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-creator-studio/\">Apple Creator Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/final-cut-pro/\">Final Cut Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/14/final-cut-pro-one-time-vs-creator-studio/\">Will Final Cut Pro on Mac Get Every New Feature Without a Subscription?

Given that Creator Studio includes many professional Mac apps, such as Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, and Pixelmator Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3031242/apple-creator-studio-m5-pro-max-macbook-pro.html\"><em>Macworld</em> speculated</a> that the week of January 28 would be a fitting time for Apple to release new MacBook Pro models too.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSecond, Apple's next quarterly earnings call is scheduled for <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/\">Thursday, January 29</a>, and the company has introduced new products shortly before these calls on numerous occasions over the years and touched on them in the opening remarks.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThird, there is precedent, as Apple unveiled <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/apple-announces-m2-pro-macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro models with M2 Pro and M2 Max chips</a> with a press release in January 2023.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAgain, all of this is speculation, so do not set your expectations too high. But, sometimes where there is smoke there is fire.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBeyond the M5 chip, the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro received only one notable change last year: PCIe 5.0 storage. Apple says this results in up to 2× faster SSD read and write speeds compared to the previous-generation model.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are likewise expected to have few other changes.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBigger changes to the MacBook Pro are expected with the two-generations-away models, in either late 2026 or at some point in 2027. Rumored upgrades include an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/16/macbook-pro-oled-touch-screen/\">OLED display with touchscreen capabilities</a>, a thinner design, built-in cellular connectivity, and M6 chips manufactured with TSMC's advanced 2nm process, for even greater year-over-year performance gains. For that reason, it will probably be wise to skip the MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips unless you really need to upgrade.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">MacBook Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/14/macbook-pro-january/\">Will Apple Announce New MacBook Pros This January?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-apple-announce-new-macbook-pros-this-january.2476038/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

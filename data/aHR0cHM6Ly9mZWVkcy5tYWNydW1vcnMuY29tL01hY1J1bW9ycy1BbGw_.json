The deal will be available through December 1 <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/offer/tvs.sbd.4000?itscg=10000&itsct=atv-apl-tv-op-learn_more-BF-112125\">on the Apple TV website</a>.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nExisting subscribers are not eligible for the discount, nor are customers who have subscriptions billed through a third-party service.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt's also worth noting that you can get a <a href=\"https://www.peacocktv.com/?plan-picker-category=bundles#ib-section-section-10\">bundle of Apple TV and Peacock Premium/Premium Plus</a> at a discounted rate this season.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Disney+ and Hulu</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/disney-new-new-holiday.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028034\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDisney has introduced a <a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/BQ7X4\">new promotion</a> on its streaming service, offering a bundle of Disney+ (with ads) and Hulu (with ads) for <a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/BQ7X4\"><strong>&#36;4.99 per month for 12 months</strong></a>, down from &#36;12.99 per month. After your first year ends it will return to the then-current monthly price unless cancelled.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/BQ7X4\"target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"fancybutton\"><div class=\"fancybadge\">61% OFF</div>Disney+ and Hulu Bundle for &#36;4.99/Month</div></a></div>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTo get the deal, head to the <a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/BQ7X4\">promotion landing page</a> on the Disney+ website and click on the Disney+/Hulu bundle option. This offer is valid only for new and eligible returning subscribers.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Audible</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/audible-holiday.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028040\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAudible's <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fhz%2Faudible%2Farya%2Fmlp\">holiday deal</a> takes the service down to only &#36;0.99 per month for your first three months, plus &#36;20 in Audible credit. This is more than 90 percent off the regular &#36;14.95 monthly price of the service.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fhz%2Faudible%2Farya%2Fmlp\"target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"fancybutton\"><div class=\"fancybadge\">OVER 90% OFF</div>Audible for &#36;0.99/Month</div></a></div>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAfter the end of your first three months, the service will auto-renew at the then-current price, unless you cancel. This offer will end on December 1.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Amazon Music Unlimited</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/amazon-music-holiday.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028042\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn another Amazon-related deal, the retailer is offering <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fmusic%2Funlimited%2F\">three months of its Amazon Music Unlimted streaming service for free</a>.

If you sign up for Walmart+ at its new discounted rate of &#36;49.00 for your first year (regular &#36;98/year), you'll find multiple streaming service discounts at your disposal.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/VxE11k\"target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"fancybutton\"><div class=\"fancybadge\">FREE</div>Paramount+ Essential with Walmart+</div></a></div>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOne of these includes the option to activate a subscription to the Paramount+ Essential plan at no extra cost, so long as you have an active Walmart+ account. This is Paramount's ad-supported tier, and you can upgrade to Paramount+ Premium for an additional monthly or yearly fee.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<h2>Peacock</h2>\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/peacock-holiday.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028044\" />\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSimilar to Paramount+, the best Peacock discount you can find this Black Friday season is <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/VxE11k\">bundled with Walmart+</a>. If you take advantage of the 50 percent off Walmart+ offer, you'll gain access to Peacock Premium at no extra cost.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/VxE11k\"target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"fancybutton\"><div class=\"fancybadge\">FREE</div>Peacock Premium with Walmart+</div></a></div>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPeacock Premium is the ad-supported tier of the streaming service, and this does not include access to Peacock Premium Plus. It's also worth noting that Walmart+ members have the option to switch between Peacock and Paramount+ once every 90 days.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf you're interested in both Apple TV and Peacock, you can get a <a href=\"https://www.peacocktv.com/?plan-picker-category=bundles#ib-section-section-10\">bundle of Apple TV and Peacock Premium/Premium Plus</a> at a discounted rate this season.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYou can find <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/15/best-black-friday-apple-deals-live-now/\"><strong>all the Apple Black Friday Deals currently available</strong></a> in our dedicated post.

The move follows Apple's confirmation last year that it had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-north-carolina-campus-paused/\">paused construction plans</a> and was seeking to renegotiate the agreement with the state. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nUnder the original deal, Apple committed to invest &#36;1 billion in North Carolina over a ten-year period, including &#36;552 million for a new corporate campus in Research Triangle Park and &#36;448 million to expand its data center footprint in Catawba County in exchange for up to &#36;845 million in tax benefits if it met strict annual hiring and spending goals. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple has still not begun construction on the campus. In June last year, the company formally asked the state to suspend the project for up to four years, noting it had added around 600 employees in the Raleigh area since 2021 but required more time before beginning major development work. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSite plans filed in 2023 showed that Apple expected to build three office buildings, several support structures, and a car park totaling around <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/30/apple-north-carolina-campus-first-phase/\">900,000 square feet</a>. The latest vote enables Apple to delay hiring requirements until the end of 2027, by which time it will need to add 126 positions to remain eligible for incentives, rising to 1,719 by year five and 2,700 by year ten.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nApple previously said the campus will focus on machine learning, artificial intelligence, software engineering, and other related fields. <div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/north-carolina/\">North Carolina</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/27/apple-reset-on-new-campus-deal/\">Apple Granted Reset on New Campus Deal</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-granted-reset-on-new-campus-deal.2472103/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"

      "content": "Apple TV has pulled its upcoming French thriller series \"The Hunt\" just days before its scheduled December 3 debut, after allegations emerged that the show plagiarized a 1973 novel and its film adaptation.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/the-hunt-apple-tv-show.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1312\" height=\"738\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028351\" />\r<br/>\nProduction company Gaumont confirmed the postponement in a statement, saying it is \"conducting a thorough review to address any questions related to our production.\" The company added that it takes \"intellectual property matters very seriously.\"\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCreator and director Cédric Anger is accused of copying the plot from late author Douglas Fairbairn's novel \"Shoot\" and the 1976 film of the same name. French media journalist <a href=\"https://clemgarin.substack.com/p/info-cgtv-apple-tv-obligee-de-jeter\">Clément Garin</a> was first to make the allegations, according to <em><a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/apple-tv-the-hunt-investigation-plagiarism-allegations-1236592163/\">Variety</a></em>. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe similarities between the two stories look fairly substantial. Both narratives follow a group of hunters who encounter rival hunters in the wilderness, leading to violent consequences. In each story, one hunter is shot and the attacker is killed in retaliation. The survivors then return home while keeping the incident secret, but they soon grow paranoid about the potential for revenge.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\"The Hunt\" was set to premiere with two episodes on December 3, followed by weekly releases through December 31, but Apple has since removed all promotional materials for the series from its website. Apple has yet to comment on the controversy. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt's the second time this year Apple TV has pulled a completed series at the last minute. Jessica Chastain's \"The Savant\" was postponed days before its September premiere and still has no release date.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/27/apple-tv-show-hunt-pulled-plagiarism-claims/\">Apple TV Pulls &#039;The Hunt&#039; Show Over Plagiarism Claims</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-pulls-the-hunt-show-over-plagiarism-claims.2472073/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>"
